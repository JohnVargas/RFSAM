# RFSAM: Radio Frequency Security Assessment Methodology

An open, structured methodology for RF research and auditing, by [Electronic Cats](https://electroniccats.com) and [PWNLabs](https://pwnlab.mx).

RFSAM is meant to be **a north** for RF work: faced with an unknown signal or device, where do you start, and how do you know what you've missed? It walks you from the spectrum up through the signal, link, crypto, attack and application layers, per protocol, with a verification procedure and a real worked example at each step.

It does **not** claim to invent RF security. OSSTMM, BSAM, the SDR‑pentest lineage and a deep body of research came first; RFSAM organises that landscape into something you can navigate by. For Bluetooth at the link layer and above it defers to [Tarlogic's BSAM](https://www.tarlogic.com/bsam/) rather than duplicating it.

## The model

Controls are indexed on two axes: **protocol** and **layer**. The layer axis is a descent from spectrum down to application:

| | layer | what it asks |
|---|---|---|
| `IG` | Info Gathering | identify components, check known CVEs (pre‑descent) |
| `SP` | Spectrum | what is transmitting, can you see it |
| `PHY` | Signal / PHY | waveform → bits |
| `LL` | Link / Protocol | frames, addressing, identifiers |
| `CR` | Crypto | pairing, keys, confidentiality, integrity |
| `AT` | Attack | injection, replay, hijack, rogue infrastructure |
| `AP` | Application | what the device trusts above the link |

Control IDs follow `RFSAM-<PROTOCOL>-<LAYER>-<NN>` (e.g. `RFSAM-BLE-AT-01`). The protocol and layer segments must match the control's fields; this is enforced in validation.

Each control carries a `reviewStatus`: **stub** (migrated outline), **draft** (researched and cited, awaiting review), or **verified** (checked). Every nontrivial claim cites a source; uncertain claims are flagged inline for review.

## Repository structure

```
src/content/controls/   one Markdown file per control (+ _template.md)
src/content/resources/   reusable procedures referenced by controls
src/content/tools/       the standard-tooling reference
src/data/                meta, layers, criticality, protocols, BSAM registry, coverage map
src/components, src/layouts, src/pages, src/styles   the Astro site
scripts/migrate.mjs      one-time import of the legacy corpus
scripts/validate.mjs     ID and cross-reference validation
scripts/export-mandates.mjs  regenerates src/data/mandates.json for the runner
runner/                  session runner: gate, planner, SoA and report (Python, stdlib only)
loot/                    demo engagement: scope files and the session outputs the demo pages read
src/lib/taxonomy.js      layer/protocol ids and the control-id rule
reference/               provenance: the original corpus and prototype
```

The site is built with [Astro](https://astro.build) and deployed to GitHub Pages at **https://electroniccats.github.io/RFSAM/**.

## Running locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # local dev server
npm run build      # static build into dist/
npm run validate   # ID + cross-reference checks
npm test           # unit tests for the scripts
```

## Session runner demo

`runner/` walks the corpus against an engagement scope. Nothing in it touches a radio: the demo replays a canned, clearly labelled simulated session.

```bash
python3 runner/soa.py --scope loot/scope.json --out loot/soa.md   # Statement of Applicability
python3 runner/plan_session.py                                    # loot/scope.json -> loot/session_plan.jsonl
python3 runner/run_session.py --speed 60                          # replay, writes loot/events.jsonl and loot/results.jsonl
python3 runner/render_report.py --audience client                 # loot/report.md
```

The site renders the result at `/demo/session` and `/demo/report`. `loot/scope-TEMPLATE.json` documents every scope field.

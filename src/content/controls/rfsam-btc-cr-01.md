title: Assess pairing and encryption key strength
protocol: BTC
layer: CR
criticality: high
applicability:
  - Bluetooth Classic (BR/EDR)
deferred: true
objective: >-
  Determine whether a Bluetooth Classic (BR/EDR) link's confidentiality can be
  broken or downgraded, recovering a legacy-PIN link key offline from a captured
  pairing, exploiting Secure Simple Pairing "Just Works" (no MITM protection), or
  forcing the negotiated encryption key down to brute-forceable entropy (KNOB) and
  impersonating a paired peer without the link key (BIAS).
intro: >-
  BR/EDR confidentiality rests on which association model the link uses and on the
  entropy of the negotiated encryption key. Legacy PIN pairing seeds the link key
  from a short/fixed PIN that falls to an offline brute force on a captured
  pairing; Secure Simple Pairing resists offline key recovery but its "Just Works"
  model has no MITM protection; and two protocol-level flaws, KNOB
  (encryption-key-entropy downgrade, CVE-2019-9506) and BIAS (impersonation of a
  paired peer, CVE-2020-10135), undercut even SSP links. RFSAM owns the
  RF-capture prerequisite, getting the pairing/authentication exchange off the
  air into a dissector, while the judgement on rejecting legacy pairing and
  enforcing a minimum encryption key size is assessed under BSAM (BSAM-PA-04,
  BSAM-EN-03).
prerequisites:
  hardware:
    - 'An ESP32 (original, BR/EDR-capable) running the BTSnifferBREDR baseband sniffer to capture the LMP pairing/authentication exchange; an Ubertooth One is a weaker Basic-Rate fallback'
  software:
    - 'BTSnifferBREDR.py host tool (Scapy/Wireshark output) for capture; Wireshark to dissect the LMP exchange; offline analysis for legacy-PIN link-key recovery (Shaked & Wool method) and KNOB/BIAS assessment of the negotiated key size and authentication flow'
  signal:
    freq: '2.402 to 2.480 GHz (79 RF channels × 1 MHz, adaptive frequency hopping ~1600 hops/s)'
    bandwidth: '1 MHz per channel'
    modulation: 'GFSK 1 Mbps (Basic Rate); π/4-DQPSK 2 Mbps & 8DPSK 3 Mbps (EDR)'
  skill: advanced
attacks:
  - name: Legacy PIN pairing offline recovery
    refs:
      - shaked2005pin
    impact: >-
      Offline recovery of the PIN and hence the link key from a captured legacy
      pairing exchange, allowing decryption of the session and impersonation of
      either peer.
    preconditions: >-
      The link uses legacy PIN pairing and the attacker captured the pairing
      (IN_RAND, COMB_KEY, AU_RAND/SRES) exchange; short or fixed PINs (0000 /
      1234) fall fastest. Modern devices rarely use legacy pairing.
    summary: >-
      A passive attacker who captures a legacy pairing replays the SAFER+ key
      derivation offline to find the PIN; a 4-digit PIN was cracked in well under
      a second on 2005-era hardware, recovering the link key.
  - name: KNOB (Key Negotiation of Bluetooth)
    cve:
      - CVE-2019-9506
    refs:
      - antonioli2019knob
      - cve-2019-9506
    impact: >-
      Forces the negotiated encryption key down to as little as 1 byte of
      entropy, after which the key is brute-forced in real time, enabling
      decryption of the ciphertext and injection of valid encrypted frames.
    preconditions: >-
      An attacker in radio range during encryption setup; a flaw in the BR/EDR
      specification (v1.0 to 5.1), so it is largely implementation-independent.
      Devices that enforce a minimum key size reject the downgrade.
    summary: >-
      The BR/EDR encryption-key negotiation lets a man-in-the-middle lower the
      key entropy to 1 byte without either victim noticing, a downgrade, not a
      cryptographic break.
  - name: BIAS (Bluetooth Impersonation AttackS)
    cve:
      - CVE-2020-10135
    refs:
      - antonioli2020bias
      - cve-2020-10135
    impact: >-
      Impersonation of a previously-paired master or slave and completion of the
      authentication handshake without possessing the link key, giving the
      attacker an authenticated session.
    preconditions: >-
      The attacker knows the BD_ADDR of a peer the target has paired with; abuses
      the legacy authentication procedure and a role switch, and combines with
      KNOB on Secure Connections links.
    summary: >-
      Exploits weaknesses in the BR/EDR authentication procedure to impersonate a
      paired device without the link key, bypassing authentication for both
      legacy and Secure Connections pairing.

    The control's authorisation note says "All active capture and any
    decryption/downgrade steps below" - conceding in passing that the capture itself
    is active. Step 2 drives the ESP32 BR/EDR baseband sniffer, which pages the
    target to follow it rather than listening from outside, and step 5 is marked
    "(Authorised, lab only)". That the word "active" appears only inside a legal
    disclaimer, and never in the objective, is why a reader takes this for a passive
    capture control.

## Mechanism

Bluetooth Classic confidentiality depends on two things: which association model derived the link key, and how much entropy the link encryption key carries. The KNOB authors frame both as protocol-level, not implementation-level, problems (antonioli2019knob).

**Legacy PIN pairing.** In legacy pairing a PIN seeds the link key through the SAFER+ key derivation. Because the PIN is often short or fixed (`0000`, `1234`), a passive attacker who captures the pairing exchange (the `IN_RAND`, `COMB_KEY` and `AU_RAND`/`SRES` messages) can replay the derivation offline and brute-force the PIN, Shaked & Wool cracked a 4-digit PIN in well under a second on 2005-era hardware, recovering the link key and hence the session (shaked2005pin). This requires capturing the pairing, and modern devices rarely use legacy pairing.

**Secure Simple Pairing (SSP).** SSP uses ECDH (P-192 in 2.1, P-256 in 4.1+) and resists offline key recovery. Its weak point is the **Just Works** association model, which has no MITM protection, an active man-in-the-middle problem rather than an offline crack. Establishing which SSP association model is in use (Just Works vs Passkey vs OOB) is the observable finding RFSAM contributes; the policy judgement is BSAM's (BSAM-PA-04).

**KNOB (CVE-2019-9506).** Independent of pairing model, the BR/EDR encryption-key-size negotiation lets a man-in-the-middle force the entropy down to as little as 1 byte without either victim being alerted; the key is then brute-forced in real time, the ciphertext decrypted and valid encrypted frames injected. NVD records this as the spec (up to v5.1) permitting a low key length and not preventing an attacker from influencing the negotiation (antonioli2019knob, cve-2019-9506). The defence is a host-enforced minimum key size (BSAM-EN-03).

**BIAS (CVE-2020-10135).** BIAS abuses the BR/EDR authentication procedure and a role switch to impersonate a previously-paired master or slave and complete authentication without the link key; it composes with KNOB to attack Secure Connections links as well (antonioli2020bias, cve-2020-10135).

This CVE coverage is representative, not exhaustive, KNOB and BIAS are spec-level flaws demonstrated across many BR/EDR chips, but patch status varies by vendor and firmware. Confirm against current advisories and the device's BR/EDR controller firmware before asserting a given target is or is not affected.

RFSAM's job at this floor is the RF-capture prerequisite, getting the LMP pairing/authentication exchange off the air and into a dissector, after which the pairing-policy and key-size verdicts are assessed under BSAM. There is no clean point-and-click ESP32 tool for the offline cracking step, so this floor is mostly analysis of the capture from the link layer plus the BSAM pairing controls.

## Procedure

> All active capture and any decryption/downgrade steps below are authorised-testing only: run them against your own devices or a target you are explicitly contracted to assess, in an RF-shielded or controlled environment, with test devices and recorded permission. The ESP32 baseband sniffer actively connects to follow the target, it is not purely passive.

1. Confirm the target is Bluetooth Classic (BR/EDR), not BLE, and note its `BD_ADDR` and Class of Device from the inquiry-scan step (see the SP-layer enumeration; RFSAM-RES-27 sets up the same BR/EDR kit).

2. Capture the pairing / authentication exchange with the ESP32 BR/EDR baseband sniffer, exporting to a PCAP for Wireshark:
   ```bash
   python3 BTSnifferBREDR.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -w btc-pairing.pcap
   ```
   Trigger a fresh pairing on the target during the capture (power-cycle / "forget device" then re-pair). The host tool dumps BT header, channel, role, FHS, ACL and LMP packets.

3. Open the capture and isolate the Link Manager Protocol exchange:
   ```bash
   wireshark btc-pairing.pcap
   # display filter:
   btbrlmp
   ```
   Read off the association model and key sizes:
   - Legacy PIN pairing shows `LMP_in_rand` / `LMP_comb_key` / `LMP_au_rand` / `LMP_sres`.
   - SSP shows the `LMP_encapsulated_*` / IO-capability exchange; identify Just Works vs Passkey vs OOB.
   - The encryption-key-size negotiation is `LMP_encryption_key_size_req`, record the **negotiated key length in bytes**. A value driven to 1 byte is the KNOB signature.

4. Classify the finding:
   - **Negotiated key size < the device's policy minimum (e.g. forced to 1 byte):** KNOB-style downgrade is feasible (antonioli2019knob, cve-2019-9506). Defer the minimum-key-size verdict to BSAM-EN-03.
   - **`LMP_in_rand` legacy pairing observed:** legacy-PIN link-key recovery applies if the pairing was captured (shaked2005pin). Defer the legacy-pairing-rejection verdict to BSAM-PA-04.
   - **SSP Just Works:** no MITM protection at association; flag for the active-MITM / impersonation path (BIAS, antonioli2020bias).

5. (Authorised, lab only) Validate exploitability rather than assert it: confirm a captured legacy pairing yields the link key offline, or that the device accepts a 1-byte key in the `LMP_encryption_key_size_req` negotiation. Record the negotiated entropy and the recovered key length as the evidence; do not claim a break you did not reproduce.

## Field case

The reference KNOB sample capture shipped by the attack's authors (francozappa/knob, `poc-internalblue/sample-nexmaster-galaxys9slave.pcapng`, a Nexus 5 master and a Galaxy S9 slave) shows exactly this signature, captured before any KNOB patch was released [knob-poc-internalblue]. Opening it in Wireshark and isolating the Link Manager exchange with the `btbrlmp` filter, the `LMP_encryption_key_size_req` negotiation in packets 121 to 127 settles on **1 byte** of entropy, 8 bits, the minimum the BR/EDR specification permits, with neither device objecting to the downgrade [knob-poc-internalblue]. The documented finding is the KNOB signature: *the encryption key size is negotiated down below any safe policy minimum*, after which the 1-byte key is brute-forced in real time and the session ciphertext decrypted (antonioli2019knob, cve-2019-9506). The exploitability verdict, that the host accepted an encryption key entropy far below policy, is exactly what RFSAM gets off the air here; enforcing a minimum encryption key size is deferred to BSAM-EN-03, and rejecting legacy pairing to BSAM-PA-04. The same `btbrlmp` read-off applies unchanged to any BR/EDR link, from car hands-free units to HID peripherals.

## Remediation

**Developer / firmware:** Reject legacy PIN pairing entirely and require Secure Simple Pairing with an authenticated association model (Passkey or OOB), never Just Works, for anything trust-bearing (BSAM-PA-04). Enforce a host-side minimum encryption key size and refuse links that negotiate below it, this is the direct defence against KNOB (BSAM-EN-03, cve-2019-9506). Where the controller and host support it, require Secure Connections (P-256) and refuse fallback to legacy authentication, which closes the BIAS legacy path (antonioli2020bias).

**Integrator:** Select BR/EDR controllers whose firmware patches the KNOB and BIAS classes, and verify the minimum-key-size enforcement is actually applied at the host (BlueZ `min_key_size` / equivalent), not just declared. Treat the KNOB/BIAS CVE list as representative, check the device's controller firmware against current vendor advisories.

**Operator:** Avoid pairing trust-bearing devices in untrusted RF environments; prefer OOB pairing where available; and where a device only offers legacy pairing or Just Works, treat its link as unauthenticated and do not place trust above it (BSAM-PA-04).

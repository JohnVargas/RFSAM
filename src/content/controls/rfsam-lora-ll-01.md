title: Profile LoRaWAN frames and harvest cleartext join identifiers
protocol: LORA
layer: LL
criticality: low
applicability:
  - LoRaWAN
deferred: false
objective: >-
  Verify whether a LoRaWAN deployment can be inventoried passively, classifying
  frames by MType and harvesting the cleartext join-procedure identifiers
  (JoinEUI/AppEUI, DevEUI, DevNonce) and the data-frame DevAddr, without
  transmitting, and use the frame mix to scope downstream weaknesses.
intro: >-
  LoRaWAN encrypts the application payload (AES-128) but transmits the
  join-procedure metadata and frame headers in the clear. A passive observer who
  has de-chirped the CSS waveform into LoRaWAN frames can map a whole deployment
  and harvest stable device and application identifiers without ever
  transmitting.
prerequisites:
  hardware:
    - 'An SDR covering the regional sub-GHz band (RTL-SDR V4 for one channel, or HackRF One / USRP B210 / bladeRF 2.0 micro for wider capture), or a multi-channel LoRaWAN gateway (RAK WisGate Connect) if you have gateway access, or an STM32WLxx board for single-board capture'
  software:
    - 'A CSS demodulator that frames LoRaWAN and exports LoRaTap PCAP, gr-lora_sdr, LoRAttack, ChirpCat (gateway), catnip (CatSniffer), or the LoRa Wideband Decoder, plus Wireshark with its LoRaTap/LoRaWAN dissectors'
  signal:
    freq: '863 to 870 MHz (EU868) / 902 to 928 MHz (US915) / regional: AS923, EU433, AU915, CN470, IN865, KR920'
    bandwidth: '125 / 250 / 500 kHz per LoRaWAN channel'
    modulation: 'CSS (Chirp Spread Spectrum), SF7 to SF12'
  skill: intermediate
attacks:
  - name: ABP replay / selective denial-of-service
    refs:
      - yang2018lorawan
    impact: >-
      Replaying a captured uplink against an ABP device whose frame counter
      resets on reboot causes the network server to accept stale frames or to
      desynchronise the legitimate device, denying it service.
    preconditions: >-
      An ABP-activated device with static session keys; a captured uplink; the
      target device's frame counter has reset (e.g. after a power cycle). The
      cleartext header harvested here identifies replayable targets.
    summary: >-
      Long-term ABP session keys outlive a single session, so a frame replayed
      after a counter reset is accepted, a selective DoS scoped by the
      passively harvested frame headers.
  - name: Plaintext recovery via keystream reuse
    refs:
      - yang2018lorawan
    impact: >-
      Two ciphertexts encrypted under the same key and frame counter share a
      keystream; XORing them recovers a combination of plaintexts (a two-time
      pad), leaking application data without the key.
    preconditions: >-
      A static session key (typical of ABP) and a frame counter that repeats
      after a reset, producing two frames with the same counter under the same
      key, both captured passively.
    summary: >-
      LoRaWAN's AES-CTR-style payload encryption reuses keystream when the frame
      counter repeats under a static key, enabling passive plaintext recovery.
  - name: Bit-flipping on the network-server-to-application-server leg
    refs:
      - lee2017bitflip
      - trendmicro2021lorawan
    impact: >-
      The MIC protects the device-to-network-server leg, but the payload the
      network server forwards to the application server is no longer
      cryptographically bound; an attacker positioned on that leg can flip bits
      to alter the delivered value undetected.
    preconditions: >-
      A position on the network-server-to-application-server interface (not the
      RF link). Passive RF capture of the frame structure scopes which fields
      are exposed but does not itself perform the flip.
    summary: >-
      Decrypted payloads forwarded from the network server to the application
      server lack end-to-end integrity, allowing bit-flipping unless an
      application-layer MIC or TLS tunnel is added.

## Mechanism

LoRaWAN is a MAC/network layer carried over the LoRa CSS PHY. The over-the-air unit is the `PHYPayload = MHDR | MACPayload | MIC(4B)`; the `MHDR` carries the message type (`MType`), and the `MACPayload` carries an `FHDR` (`DevAddr`, `FCtrl`, `FCnt`, `FOpts`), an `FPort`, and the `FRMPayload` [loraalliance2020l2]. Only the `FRMPayload` is encrypted (AES-128 under the AppSKey); the headers, including the stable `DevAddr`, travel in the clear, and the MIC is an AES-128-CMAC keyed by the NwkSKey rather than an encryption layer [loraalliance2020l2].

The join procedure is even more exposed. In OTAA, the `JoinRequest` carries `JoinEUI`/`AppEUI`, `DevEUI`, and a `DevNonce` **before any session key exists**; these fields are sent in the clear and protected only by a MIC computed with the AppKey, so the key is never transmitted but the identifiers are fully readable [loraalliance2020l2]. A passive receiver that has de-chirped the waveform into frames can therefore classify traffic by `MType` (Join Request, Join Accept, Unconfirmed/Confirmed Data Up/Down) and inventory a whole deployment, which devices exist, which are joining, how often, and harvest fleet-wide identifiers, all without transmitting.

This passive frame profile is the scoping step for the documented LoRaWAN attack families, which this control does not itself execute:

- **ABP replay / selective DoS.** Yang et al. show that because ABP session keys are long-term and outlive a single session, an uplink replayed after a device's frame counter resets is accepted, causing a selective denial-of-service or desynchronisation [yang2018lorawan]. The cleartext `DevAddr` and `FCnt` harvested here identify which devices are replayable.
- **Plaintext recovery by keystream reuse.** The same work demonstrates that the AES-CTR-style payload encryption reuses keystream when the frame counter repeats under a static key, so XORing two such ciphertexts recovers plaintext, a classic two-time pad reachable from passive capture alone [yang2018lorawan].
- **Bit-flipping on the backend leg.** The MIC protects the device-to-network-server hop, but the payload the network server decrypts and forwards to the application server is no longer cryptographically bound; Lee et al. analyse the resulting bit-flipping risk and propose a field-shuffling countermeasure [lee2017bitflip], and Trend Micro independently note the same unprotected NS→AS leg and recommend an application-layer MIC or a TLS tunnel [trendmicro2021lorawan]. This attack targets the network-server-to-application-server backend interface, not the RF link: passive capture here only scopes which fields are exposed, so verify the backend topology before asserting exploitability for a given deployment.

A high proportion of `JoinRequest` frames relative to data frames is itself a finding: it indicates devices repeatedly failing to join (lost downlinks, poor coverage, mis-provisioned keys), so the network is in effect broadcasting its own poor health and offering more cleartext identifiers to harvest.

## Procedure

> Authorised testing only, capture is passive, but confirm you have written
> permission to receive and analyse the target network's traffic and that
> passive RF interception is lawful in your jurisdiction. Do not transmit at
> this layer.

1. **Confirm the band and channel plan** (from RFSAM-RES-07 / the IG and SP steps). Set the regional sub-band you will capture, e.g. EU868 (863 to 870 MHz) or US915 (902 to 928 MHz), and the bandwidth (125/250/500 kHz) and spreading factor (SF7 to SF12) in play.

2. **De-chirp the CSS waveform into LoRaWAN frames.** With an SDR, run a soft-decision LoRa receiver such as gr-lora_sdr [grlorasdr], which provides sync, timing and frequency-offset correction down to low SNR. Its example decoders take the centre frequency, bandwidth and spreading factor and emit decoded frames:
   ```bash
   # gr-lora_sdr ships GNU Radio example flowgraphs / apps under examples/ and apps/
   gnuradio-companion examples/rx.grc      # set: samp_rate ≥ bandwidth, center_freq, bw=125e3, sf=7..12
   ```
   Expected: decoded `PHYPayload` hex per received packet on stdout / the message sink. Confirm CRC-valid frames are appearing; if not, recheck SF/BW and that the sample rate covers the channel bandwidth.

3. **Or capture multi-channel into LoRaTap PCAP** with LoRAttack [lorattackrepo]. Set the centre frequency, bandwidth, sample rate and spreading factor in `config/sniffer.config`, then launch the interactive sniffer and choose bidirectional / uplink / downlink:
   ```bash
   ./run.sh        # menu: "Sniff Up/Down link (Bidirectional)"
   ```
   Expected: a PCAP per session under the tool's capture directory. The `*_wireshark` PCAPs have the UDP header stripped and the DLT set for Wireshark. (Author notes the sniffer is tested mainly at 125 kHz and is under active construction, verify against your band/SF.)

4. **Or, with gateway access**, read whole uplink+downlink frames off a concentrator with ChirpCat (RAK WisGate Connect, Semtech UDP packet forwarder), or capture the whole sub-band at once with the LoRa Wideband Decoder, or use catnip on a CatSniffer SX1262 for single-radio capture, each captures LoRaWAN frames without an SDR de-chirp flow.

5. **Dissect in Wireshark.** Open the LoRaTap PCAP; Wireshark's `loratap`/`lorawan` dissectors decode the `PHYPayload` [loratap]. The LoRaWAN dissector registers under LoRaTap and parses the `MHDR`/`MType`, `FHDR` (`DevAddr`, `FCtrl`, `FCnt`), and the join fields. Filter and classify:
   ```text
   lorawan.mtype == 0           # Join Request   (JoinEUI/AppEUI, DevEUI, DevNonce in clear)
   lorawan.mtype == 1           # Join Accept    (encrypted)
   lorawan.mtype == 2 || lorawan.mtype == 4   # Unconfirmed / Confirmed Data Up
   ```
   Expected: a per-frame breakdown with the cleartext identifiers visible; the `FRMPayload` remains AES-128 ciphertext.

6. **Inventory identifiers and compute the frame mix.** From the Join Requests, extract the cleartext `JoinEUI`/`AppEUI`, `DevEUI`, and `DevNonce`; from data frames, the `DevAddr`. Tabulate unique devices and compute the `JoinRequest`-to-data ratio as a network-health and attack-surface indicator. Flag any repeated `DevNonce` values: on LoRaWAN 1.0.x a repeated `DevNonce` indicates random-nonce join-replay exposure (1.0.4 and 1.1 require `DevNonce` to be a monotonic counter that is never reused) [loraalliance2020l2].

## Field case

Reported field observation (the author's own measurement on an authorised network, reproduced here as an illustrative figure, not independently re-measured for this control): a passive US915 capture of 51,304 LoRaWAN frames showed 45,815 (89.3%) were JoinRequests, nine of every ten frames were devices trying, and failing, to join. The structure read entirely in the clear (MHDR + DevAddr; AppEUI/DevEUI/DevNonce in the join), letting an observer harvest the fleet's identities and map the network without ever transmitting. The payloads stayed AES-protected, but the metadata alone profiled the deployment and exposed it as misconfigured. (Such a JoinRequest skew is consistent with the US915 channel-plan mismatch, where a 64-channel device randomly retries joins until one lands on the gateway's active 8-channel sub-band.)

To reproduce against your own authorised test network, stand up a couple of devices on a ChirpStack/RAK gateway, mis-provision one (wrong AppKey or a region/coverage mismatch) so it loops on join, then run the capture in step 3 and tabulate the `MType` mix:

```text
# example tally from a Wireshark export of an authorised test capture
MType                 frames      %
Join Request          [FILL: count]   [FILL: %]
Join Accept           [FILL: count]   [FILL: %]
Unconfirmed Data Up   [FILL: count]   [FILL: %]
...
unique DevEUI seen    [FILL: n]
unique DevAddr seen   [FILL: n]
repeated DevNonce     [FILL: y/n]
```

The expected shape: a mis-provisioned fleet skews heavily toward Join Requests, in line with the reported 89.3% observation above, and every Join Request hands you a `DevEUI`/`JoinEUI`/`DevNonce` in the clear. The `[FILL: …]` rows are placeholders for the reader's own authorised capture, substitute the values you capture; do not treat them as measured values.

## Remediation

**Developer (device / stack).** Use OTAA over ABP so session keys are derived afresh at each join and the frame counter cannot trivially reset into keystream reuse [yang2018lorawan]. Target LoRaWAN 1.0.4 or 1.1, where `DevNonce` is a monotonic counter that is never reused, closing the random-nonce join-replay window [loraalliance2020l2]. Treat `DevEUI`/`JoinEUI` as non-secret identifiers (they are unavoidably on the air) but do not derive any security from their secrecy.

**Integrator (network / application server).** Add end-to-end protection across the network-server-to-application-server leg, an application-layer MIC computed with the AppSKey, or a TLS tunnel (ideally with a client certificate), so a decrypted, forwarded payload cannot be bit-flipped undetected [lee2017bitflip][trendmicro2021lorawan]. For ABP deployments, enforce server-side frame-counter validation that survives device reboots rather than accepting a reset counter, neutralising the replay/DoS path [yang2018lorawan].

**Operator (deployment).** Minimise join churn through correct provisioning and adequate downlink coverage: a deployment that constantly re-joins is leaking the maximum number of cleartext identifiers and advertising its own misconfiguration. Periodically run this passive profile against your own network as a monitoring control, a rising `JoinRequest` ratio is an early signal of provisioning or coverage failure, not just an attacker's reconnaissance aid.

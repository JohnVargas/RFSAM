title: Survey bands, channels and monitor-mode capture feasibility
protocol: WIFI
layer: SP
criticality: info
applicability:
  - 802.11 b/g/n (2.4 GHz)
  - 802.11 a/n/ac/ax (5 GHz)
  - 802.11 ax/be (6 GHz, Wi-Fi 6E/7)
deferred: false
objective: >-
  Establish which 802.11 bands and channels carry traffic in scope, enumerate
  the access points and clients on each, and confirm whether the auditing radio
  can passively capture (and, where later controls require it, inject) on every
  band the targets use, so a later "not seen" is recorded as a capability gap,
  not an all-clear.
intro: >-
  Wi-Fi spans three bands and dozens of channels, and a radio listens to only
  one channel at a time, so a survey means channel-hopping and logging every AP
  and client heard. A standard monitor-mode adapter covers 2.4 and 5 GHz; 6 GHz
  (Wi-Fi 6E/7) needs a 6 GHz-capable radio, and many 5 GHz channels are gated by
  DFS. This control draws the map and records the adapter's capability envelope
  before any active step.

    The authorisation note says "Steps 2-6 here transmit nothing; the deauth/injection
    check in step 5 is an active transmission" - which contradicts itself, since 5 is
    inside 2-6. It is also wrong about step 6: hcxdumptool is not a receiver, it sends
    association/EAPOL requests to obtain a clientless PMKID and, depending on version,
    deauthenticates to provoke it. Step 5's injection test knocks clients off, hence
    dos. The control carries reviewStatus: verified, which lends that sentence more
    authority than it has earned.

## Mechanism

802.11 operates across three unlicensed bands: 2.4 GHz (2.400 to 2.4835 GHz), the 5 GHz U-NII bands (~5.15 to 5.85 GHz), and, since the 2020 FCC order opening 1200 MHz of new spectrum, 6 GHz (5.925 to 7.125 GHz), used by Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7 [fcc-6ghz-2020][ieee80211-2020]. The PHY is DSSS for legacy 2.4 GHz rates and OFDM/OFDMA for 802.11a/g/n/ac/ax, in channels of 20/40/80/160 MHz (320 MHz in Wi-Fi 7) [ieee80211-2020]. A receiver demodulates only the channel it is tuned to, so observing a whole environment means hopping channels and logging what is heard on each, the survey.

Passive capture depends on **monitor mode**: outside monitor mode an adapter delivers only unicast traffic to/from the host plus broadcast/multicast, often with synthetic Ethernet headers and no radio metadata; in monitor mode the adapter's frame filter is switched off and every received 802.11 frame, management, control and data, is delivered to userspace with a radio-layer header [wireshark-wlan]. That per-frame metadata (channel, rate, signal) is carried in a **radiotap** header prepended to each captured frame, the de facto standard for 802.11 reception and injection across Linux drivers and libpcap [radiotap]. Whether a given adapter supports monitor mode, and on which bands, is a property of its chipset and driver, not every adapter does it, and many built-in cards cannot inject at all [wireshark-wlan].

Two band-specific constraints scope what a survey can see. **DFS (Dynamic Frequency Selection):** many 5 GHz channels are shared with radar; before a master transmits on a DFS channel it must perform a Channel Availability Check, sitting idle and listening for radar pulses, and must vacate on detection [linux-dfs]. A passive survey can still *receive* on DFS channels, but APs may be sparse or absent there, and an injection-capable adapter will refuse to transmit until CAC completes, relevant to later active controls. **6 GHz:** Wi-Fi 6E/7 traffic is invisible to a 2.4/5 GHz-only adapter; capturing it requires a 6 GHz-capable radio [fcc-6ghz-2020]. Recording these gaps is the point of this control: it sets the honest scope so a later "no handshake / no AP seen" is read as a capability limit, not a clean result.

This is an observational, capture-feasibility control, the map drawn before any AT-layer step (deauthentication, rogue AP) is attempted. It carries no offensive technique of its own, hence no `attacks[]`.

## Procedure

> Authorised-testing framing: even a "passive" survey can capture other parties' frames and (with GPS) their locations. Run it only within an authorised scope, against networks you own or are permitted to assess, and store captures as sensitive evidence. Steps 2 to 6 here transmit nothing; the deauth/injection check in step 5 is an active transmission and must stay inside that authorisation.

1. **Identify the adapter and its bands.** Confirm the chipset and which bands the driver exposes:
   ```bash
   iw list | grep -A40 'Band'
   ```
   Each `Band N:` block lists the frequencies/channels the radio can tune. Note whether 5 GHz and/or 6 GHz bands appear at all, absence here is a hard capability gap [wireshark-wlan].

2. **Enter monitor mode.** Put the interface into monitor mode and kill processes that would fight it:
   ```bash
   sudo airmon-ng check kill
   sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
   ```
   `airmon-ng` reports the new monitor interface (typically `wlan0mon`). Confirm it with `iw dev` showing `type monitor` [aircrack-ng][wireshark-wlan].

3. **Survey 2.4 and 5 GHz.** Channel-hop and log every AP and client:
   ```bash
   sudo airodump-ng --band abg wlan0mon
   ```
   The live table lists BSSID, channel (`CH`), encryption (`ENC`/`CIPHER`/`AUTH`), signal (`PWR`) and associated stations. `--band a` is 5 GHz, `b`/`g` are 2.4 GHz [aircrack-ng]. Record the channels in use and the security mode read from each beacon's RSN element.

4. **Quiet / logged survey with GPS (wardriving).** For a non-transmitting map of a wider area, use Kismet, which channel-hops and logs every AP/client/SSID to pcapng with GPS and never transmits [kismet]:
   ```bash
   kismet -c wlan0mon
   ```
   Open the web UI (`http://localhost:2501`); each device row carries its band, channel, last-seen and (with a gpsd source) location. For a standalone, laptop-free 2.4 GHz survey/wardrive, an Electronic Cats Minino (ESP32-C6) logs SSIDs and GPS fixes to microSD [minino].

5. **Confirm injection (only if later active controls need it).** Before relying on any deauth/handshake-forcing control, verify the adapter can actually transmit on the target band:
   ```bash
   sudo aireplay-ng --test wlan0mon
   ```
   `Injection is working!` confirms transmit capability; a failure means later "no handshake captured" results would be your radio, not the target [aircrack-ng]. This step transmits, keep it inside the authorised scope.

6. **Record DFS / 6 GHz gaps.** Note any 5 GHz DFS channels where the survey saw no traffic (an AP may be present but the radio cannot be confirmed there without CAC) [linux-dfs], and explicitly record whether 6 GHz was surveyed at all, a 2.4/5 GHz adapter cannot see Wi-Fi 6E/7 [fcc-6ghz-2020]. Optionally confirm key-material capture feasibility with a clientless PMKID probe (`hcxdumptool`) on in-scope APs, written as pcapng for the CR-layer control [hcxdumptool].

## Field case

Illustrative walkthrough, substitute the values you capture. Surveying a small-office network in scope, an ALFA AWUS036ACH (RTL8812AU) in monitor mode is hopped across 2.4 and 5 GHz with `airodump-ng --band abg`. A typical 2.4 GHz pass finds the target SSID on channel 6 (WPA2-PSK/CCMP) plus two neighbour APs on 1 and 11; the 5 GHz pass finds the same ESSID's `ac` BSSID on channel 36 (non-DFS). `aireplay-ng --test wlan0mon` returning `Injection is working!` on channel 6 is what scopes the later handshake-capture control as feasible on 2.4 GHz.

The point of the survey is that the two gaps below get recorded, not hidden:
- **6 GHz not surveyed**, the RTL8812AU has no 6 GHz radio, so any Wi-Fi 6E client steering to 6 GHz is invisible. Mark it as a capability gap requiring a Wi-Fi 6E adapter to close [fcc-6ghz-2020].
- **5 GHz DFS channels (52 to 144)**, no APs observed there, but a passive sweep cannot distinguish "no AP" from "AP present, not captured" on DFS channels without a longer dwell; record it as `unconfirmed` rather than `clear` [linux-dfs].

Record the measured signal level for each BSSID from the live `airodump-ng` table rather than assuming it. For a documented public reference of that table format, the sample airodump-ng survey CSV shipped with aircrack-ng (aircrack-ng/aircrack-ng, `scripts/airgraph-ng/test/test-1.txt`) carries a `Power` column per BSSID [airodump-csv]: `02:1D:7E:47:F6:B3` (ch 11, WPA2/CCMP/PSK, ESSID `kwifi`) Power 18; `00:13:46:08:87:0E` (ch 6, WPA/TKIP/PSK, `kevinh`) Power 14; `00:16:B6:39:B6:ED` (ch 6, WPA2/CCMP/PSK, `giggity`) Power 14; `00:02:2D:8E:F9:FB` (ch 1, WEP) Power 20; and `02:7A:75:47:0E:87` (ch 11, OPN) Power -1. One caveat when reading any such table: this older capture stores Power as a positive magnitude with `-1` as the no-signal sentinel, whereas the current airodump-ng live-table convention (per its manpage) is negative dBm, strong ≈ -40, average ≈ -55, weak ≈ -70, and `-1` meaning the driver does not report a signal level [airodump-csv]. Read each BSSID's value against whichever convention your build emits, and treat `-1` as "no reading," not "very weak."

## Remediation

This is an auditor-capability baseline rather than a device finding, its "remediation" is twofold: hardening guidance for the defender, and discipline for the auditor.

- **Developer / vendor:** Do not rely on a hidden SSID or an unusual channel for security, a passive survey enumerates the BSSID, channel and security mode from beacons regardless [ieee80211-2020][wireshark-wlan]. Set the strongest mutually supported security (WPA3-SAE; WPA2-CCMP at minimum) and enable Protected Management Frames (802.11w) so later AT-layer deauth controls find no easy target. On the 6 GHz band, opened for unlicensed use by the 2020 FCC order [fcc-6ghz-2020], WPA3 (or OWE) and PMF are mandatory by Wi-Fi Alliance certification, with no WPA2/transition mode permitted [wpa3-spec].
- **Integrator / operator:** Inventory which bands your estate actually uses and ensure monitoring/IDS covers all of them, including 6 GHz and DFS channels, an attacker steering a client to an unmonitored band exploits the same blind spot this control measures [fcc-6ghz-2020][linux-dfs]. Deploy wireless IDS to flag rogue APs and deauth floods that a survey would otherwise only reveal after the fact.
- **Auditor:** Always confirm and document the adapter's band coverage and injection capability up front (steps 1, 5) so scope is honest; treat every "not seen" on an unsupported band or unconfirmed DFS channel as a capability gap, never an all-clear. Channel corpora and adapter chipset support date quickly, verify current driver/monitor-mode status for your hardware rather than assuming [wireshark-wlan].

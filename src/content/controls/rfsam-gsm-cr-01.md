title: Assess A5 ciphering and IMSI/TMSI exposure
protocol: GSM
layer: CR
criticality: high
applicability:
  - GSM
  - 2G
deferred: false
objective: >-
  Determine, from passive capture of a GSM cell, which A5 ciphering algorithm the
  network negotiates (A5/0 none, A5/1, A5/2, or A5/3) and whether subscriber
  identities are exposed on the air, i.e. whether the cell ever pages or
  identity-requests the permanent IMSI rather than a temporary TMSI, establishing
  whether the session is confidentiality-protected and whether subscribers are
  trackable.
intro: >-
  GSM's confidentiality rests on the A5 stream ciphers and on hiding the permanent
  subscriber identity (IMSI) behind a temporary one (TMSI). Both are observable
  from the air: the Cipher Mode Command names the A5 algorithm in force, and paging
  / Identity Request messages reveal whether the IMSI is exposed. A5/1 and A5/2 have
  public, practical attacks, and GSM authenticates one-way (the network never proves
  itself), so a weak cipher or an exposed IMSI is both a confidentiality and a
  privacy finding. The BSAM registry is Bluetooth-only, so RFSAM owns this control
  end to end.
prerequisites:
  hardware:
    - 'An RTL-SDR V4 reaches GSM-850/900 and DCS-1800; for PCS-1900 (top of the RTL-SDR range) prefer a HackRF One, bladeRF 2.0 micro, or USRP B210'
    - 'Reception only, this control transmits nothing'
  software:
    - 'kalibrate-rtl to find a live ARFCN; gr-gsm (grgsm_livemon) to demodulate and decode the downlink; Wireshark to read the GSMTAP stream; Oros42 IMSI-catcher to extract paged identities; Kraken + the A5/1 rainbow tables only for the authorised lab key-recovery step'
  signal:
    freq: 'GSM-850 / E-GSM-900 / DCS-1800 / PCS-1900 MHz (band depends on region); downlink/uplink paired FDD, 45 MHz (900) / 95 MHz (1800) apart'
    bandwidth: '200 kHz per ARFCN carrier; each carrier TDMA-divided into 8 timeslots'
    modulation: 'GMSK (0.3 BT Gaussian-filtered MSK) at 270.833 kbit/s'
  skill: advanced
attacks:
  - name: A5/2 instant ciphertext-only cryptanalysis (and active A5/2 downgrade)
    refs:
      - barkan2003instant
    impact: >-
      Recovers the A5/2 session key from a few dozen milliseconds of ciphertext in
      under a second on a PC; because A5/1 and A5/2 derive the session key the same
      way, an active attacker can force a handset down to A5/2, recover the key, and
      decrypt previously-recorded A5/1 traffic.
    preconditions: >-
      Target call/SMS encrypted with A5/2 (passive break), or an active man-in-the-middle
      able to issue a Cipher Mode Command selecting A5/2 (downgrade). A5/2 is prohibited
      in modern handsets, so this is chiefly a legacy / lab finding.
    summary: >-
      The foundational ciphertext-only attack on A5/2 and the active downgrade that
      undermines A5/1, establishing why the negotiated A5 algorithm, not just its
      presence, is the finding.
  - name: A5/1 rainbow-table key recovery
    refs:
      - nohl2009gsm
    impact: >-
      Recovers the 64-bit A5/1 session key Kc from a known-keystream slice using
      precomputed rainbow tables; with Kc the rest of the captured A5/1 call or SMS
      decrypts.
    preconditions: >-
      The cell runs A5/1, the capture contains a recoverable known-keystream segment,
      and the operator holds the ~1.6 to 2 TB rainbow tables. Heavy but public. No effect
      on A5/3 (KASUMI).
    summary: >-
      The Berlin A5/1 Security Project's public rainbow tables, presented as
      "GSM SRSLY?" at 26C3, turned A5/1 key recovery from theory into an
      off-the-shelf capability.
  - name: IMSI exposure / one-way authentication (IMSI-catcher signature)
    refs:
      - dabrowski2014imsi
      - 3gpp24008
    impact: >-
      A cell that pages by IMSI or issues an Identity Request for the IMSI lets a
      passive observer harvest the permanent identity and track the subscriber; the
      same one-way-authentication weakness is what an active IMSI catcher abuses to
      force IMSI disclosure and weak/no ciphering.
    preconditions: >-
      Passive finding: the cell exposes the IMSI on the air (no valid TMSI held, or
      during location update). The active variant needs a rogue cell (out of scope
      for this passive control, see the AT-layer control).
    summary: >-
      GSM authenticates one-way, so on-air IMSI exposure is both a privacy finding
      and the signature an active IMSI catcher relies on; this control measures the
      passive exposure.

    Receive-only, and unusually well declared: prerequisites say "Reception only -
    this control transmits nothing" and step 1 repeats "All steps are passive
    reception of what the network already broadcasts". Even step 6, the A5/1 key
    recovery, runs offline against a capture. But this is the control that shows
    what requires_tx cannot carry: intercepting third-party cellular traffic is
    unlawful in most jurisdictions including Peru, and by the corpus rule a control
    that does not transmit carries no tier - so nothing machine-readable separates
    this from an offline LoRa analysis. The mandate and jurisdiction decide it.

## Mechanism

GSM confidentiality is supplied by the A5 family of ciphers, applied to the radio link after the network sends a Cipher Mode Command naming the algorithm to use. The algorithm in force is therefore *readable on the air* from that L3 signalling message, it is the single most decisive fact about the link. A5/0 is no ciphering at all; A5/1 is a 64-bit stream cipher; A5/2 is an export-weakened variant; A5/3 and A5/4 use the KASUMI block cipher and are far stronger [welte2010a52]. The negotiated algorithm matters more than its mere presence because the weaker options are publicly broken.

A5/2 falls to a **ciphertext-only** attack: Barkan, Biham and Keller showed that a few dozen milliseconds of A5/2 ciphertext yield the session key in under a second on a PC, and, crucially, because A5/1 and A5/2 derive the session key Kc the same way, an active man-in-the-middle can issue a Cipher Mode Command that forces a handset down to A5/2, recover Kc, and use it to decrypt traffic that was actually recorded under A5/1 [barkan2003instant]. This shared-key-generation downgrade is why A5/2 was eventually withdrawn from handsets entirely, a process Welte documents [welte2010a52]. A5/1 itself was moved from theory to off-the-shelf capability by the Berlin A5/1 Security Project: precomputed rainbow tables (~1.6 to 2 TB), published as "GSM SRSLY?" at 26C3, recover the 64-bit Kc from a known-keystream slice, after which the rest of the captured A5/1 call or SMS decrypts [nohl2009gsm]. None of this touches A5/3 (KASUMI), so confirming an A5/3 cell is a materially stronger result than confirming A5/1.

The second axis is identity. The permanent subscriber identity (IMSI) is meant to be hidden behind a network-assigned temporary identity (TMSI); the IMSI is only supposed to appear on the air during attach or location update when no valid TMSI is held. The network can, however, compel disclosure: the Identification procedure of the L3 mobility-management protocol lets the network send an Identity Request for the IMSI or IMEI, which the handset answers [3gpp24008]. Because GSM authentication is **one-way**, the handset authenticates to the network, but the network never proves itself to the handset, a passive observer that sees the cell paging by IMSI, or sees an IMSI in an Identity Response, has both a privacy finding (the subscriber is trackable) and the on-air signature that an active IMSI catcher exploits by impersonating the cell and demanding the IMSI plus weak or absent ciphering [dabrowski2014imsi]. This control measures the *passive* exposure; the active rogue-cell technique is authorised-testing-only and belongs to the GSM AT-layer control.

## Procedure

All steps are **passive reception** of what the network already broadcasts, on equipment you own or are authorised to test. Step 5 (key recovery) decrypts traffic and is **authorised-testing-only**: a licensed lab or RF-shielded enclosure with explicit permission and your own test SIMs, recovering keys from live traffic you are not authorised to intercept is illegal in most jurisdictions.

1. **Find a live cell and its ARFCN.** Sweep the regional band with kalibrate to list carriers with a live BTS, their power, and the radio's clock error:
   ```bash
   kal -s GSM900 -g 40
   ```
   Expected: a table of channels, e.g. `chan: 12 (944.4MHz ...) power: 159873.12`. Pick the strongest channel, then read its exact ppm offset so the receiver locks cleanly:
   ```bash
   kal -c 12 -g 40
   ```
   Expected: an `average absolute error: <N> ppm` line, note that ppm for the next step. (Use a HackRF/UHD kalibrate fork instead of `kal` (`kalibrate-rtl`) for those radios; PCS-1900 needs a HackRF/bladeRF/USRP.)

2. **Demodulate and decode the downlink.** Tune the found ARFCN's downlink frequency with gr-gsm, applying the ppm correction:
   ```bash
   grgsm_livemon_headless -f 944.4M -g 40 --ppm <N>
   ```
   It demodulates the GMSK bursts, decodes the BCCH/CCCH/SDCCH control channels, and forwards each frame as GSMTAP over UDP to localhost port 4729.

3. **Read the signalling in Wireshark.** Capture the GSMTAP stream on loopback:
   ```bash
   sudo wireshark -k -i lo -f 'udp port 4729' -Y 'gsmtap'
   ```
   Confirm System Information, paging and assignment frames are scrolling, this proves the decode chain is working before you assess crypto or identity.

4. **Determine the negotiated A5 algorithm.** In Wireshark, filter for the cipher-mode signalling:
   ```text
   gsm_a.dtap.msg_rr_type == 0x35
   ```
   Open the **Cipher Mode Command** and read the *Cipher Mode Setting* / algorithm identifier: it states A5/0 (no ciphering), A5/1, A5/2, or A5/3. This is the control's primary verdict. A cell that sets A5/0 or A5/2 is a finding on its own [barkan2003instant]; A5/1 is breakable with the rainbow tables [nohl2009gsm]; A5/3 is the hardened case.

5. **Assess identity exposure.** Two checks:
   - In Wireshark, inspect **Paging Request** messages, filter `gsm_a.dtap` and look at the mobile-identity IE: if the cell pages by **IMSI** (rather than TMSI), or you see an **Identity Request** for the IMSI followed by an **Identity Response** carrying it, the permanent identity is exposed [3gpp24008].
   - Cross-check passively with the Oros42 IMSI-catcher, which consumes the same GSMTAP stream and prints harvested identities:
     ```bash
     python3 simple_IMSI-catcher.py --sniff
     ```
     Expected: lines pairing TMSI/IMSI with country/operator for handsets the cell pages, concrete evidence of on-air identity exposure with **no transmission** [dabrowski2014imsi].

6. **(Authorised lab only) Recover the A5/1 key.** Where the cell runs A5/1 and you are authorised to decrypt, isolate a burst with a recoverable known-keystream segment from the capture and feed it to Kraken against the rainbow tables to recover Kc, which then decrypts the rest of the captured A5/1 session [nohl2009gsm]:
   ```bash
   ./kraken indexes
   crack 001110001100... (114-bit known keystream)
   ```
   Expected: Kraken searches the tables and, on success, prints the recovered internal state / Kc. No effect on A5/3.

## Field case

Worked from a public sample capture rather than a live target: gr-gsm ships the SRLabs "Airprobe How-To" capture `vf_call6_a725_d174_g5_Kc1EF00BAB3BAC7002.cfile` (ptrkrysik/test_data; the README records its SRLabs origin), and the gr-gsm "Usage: Decoding How-To" wiki plus the project's CI decode fixtures replay it end to end [grgsmtestdata]. Decoding it with `grgsm_decode -c vf_call6_a725_d174_g5_Kc1EF00BAB3BAC7002.cfile -s $((100000000/174)) -a 725 -m BCCH -t 0` (decimation 174, so a 100e6/174 sample rate) confirms the carrier on **ARFCN 725 (E-GSM-900 downlink)**, and re-running on the SDCCH8 with the recovered key (`-m SDCCH8 -t 1 -e 1 -k 0x1E,0xF0,0x0B,0xAB,0x3B,0xAC,0x70,0x02`) decrypts the session. In the decrypted SDCCH8 fixture the **RR Cipher Mode Command** carries a Cipher Mode Setting whose start-ciphering bit is set with algorithm identifier `000`, i.e. **A5/1**; the recovered 64-bit A5/1 session key is `Kc = 1E F0 0B AB 3B AC 70 02`. The identity exchanged on the air is **TMSI only**, the paging / identity IEs carry P-TMSI values (e.g. `0x014faf9a`, `0x015c5703`); no IMSI is exposed in the documented decode [grgsmtestdata]. Findings for this public sample:

- ARFCN / downlink: ARFCN 725 (E-GSM-900 downlink), decoded at sample rate 100e6/174 (decimation 174) [grgsmtestdata]
- Cipher Mode Command algorithm: A5/1 (Cipher Mode Setting byte `0x11`, start-ciphering bit set, algorithm identifier `000` = A5/1); recovered session key `Kc = 1E F0 0B AB 3B AC 70 02` [grgsmtestdata]
- Identity seen on the air: TMSI only, P-TMSI values such as `0x014faf9a` and `0x015c5703`; no IMSI exposed in the documented decode [grgsmtestdata]
- Verdict: A5/1 in force, a publicly broken cipher whose 64-bit Kc is recoverable from the captured keystream (here `1E F0 0B AB 3B AC 70 02`), so a confidentiality finding; identity handling is sound for this sample (TMSI only, no IMSI on the air) [grgsmtestdata]

This is a documented public example, not a live interception: the capture, the decode commands, the negotiated A5/1, the recovered Kc and the TMSI-only identity behaviour are all taken from the gr-gsm sample capture and its wiki / CI fixtures [grgsmtestdata]. Against your own authorised target, substitute the ARFCN, A5 algorithm and identity finding you actually measure; no claim is made about any production network.

## Remediation

**Developer (handset / modem vendors).** Reject A5/2 outright and refuse to fall back to A5/0 or A5/1 once a stronger algorithm has been used in the area, closing the shared-key-generation downgrade that lets a forced A5/2 session expose previously-recorded A5/1 traffic [barkan2003instant] [welte2010a52]. Surface the negotiated cipher to the user/operator where possible, and prefer A5/3 (KASUMI) where the network offers it.

**Integrator (device OEMs / IoT product owners).** For new designs, do not ship 2G-only radios for anything carrying sensitive data; where 2G is a fallback, treat the GSM link as unauthenticated and unconfidential by default and add end-to-end application-layer encryption and authentication above it, so an exposed IMSI or a recovered Kc does not yield plaintext. Disable 2G entirely on devices that do not need it, removing the downgrade target.

**Operator (network / defenders / assessors).** Run A5/3 and disable A5/1 and A5/2 on the radio network; A5/2 was withdrawn from handsets precisely because of the downgrade-to-A5/2 break [welte2010a52]. Minimise IMSI exposure by reallocating TMSIs promptly and avoiding IMSI paging, since frequent IMSI exposure is both a privacy weakness and the signature of an active IMSI catcher [dabrowski2014imsi] [3gpp24008]. For assessors: the cipher-and-identity read in steps 1 to 5 is fully passive and safe to run on equipment you are authorised to monitor; the key-recovery step 6 and any active rogue-cell work are authorised-testing-only (own equipment, test SIMs, RF shielding, explicit permission). There is no BSAM cellular control to defer to, this is RFSAM's domain.

title: Identify the device, BR/EDR mode and vulnerability corpus
protocol: BTC
layer: IG
criticality: info
applicability:
  - BR/EDR
  - Bluetooth Classic
deferred: true
objective: >-
  Determine whether the target speaks Bluetooth Classic (BR/EDR) versus LE-only
  versus dual-mode, fingerprint the controller SoC and host stack, and check the
  published Bluetooth-Classic vulnerability corpus, using the RF prerequisite
  (confirming BR/EDR and reading BD_ADDR / Class of Device from an inquiry scan)
  to feed the BSAM Information-Gathering controls.
intro: >-
  Triaging the silicon, the host stack and the published Bluetooth-Classic
  vulnerability corpus is BSAM's territory, and BSAM does it thoroughly. RFSAM
  defers to the BSAM Information-Gathering controls (BSAM-IG-02 controller
  vulnerabilities, BSAM-IG-03 host-stack vulnerabilities, BSAM-IG-04 standard
  vulnerabilities) and adds only the RF prerequisite: confirming the device is
  Classic (BR/EDR) rather than LE-only, and reading its BD_ADDR and Class of
  Device from an inquiry scan, so those controls have a component inventory to
  work from.
prerequisites:
  hardware:
    - 'An original ESP32 (DevKit), its controller has a real BR/EDR radio, so it can run a true Bluetooth Classic inquiry. An ESP32-S3/C-series is LE-only and cannot.'
    - 'Optional: the device label / FCC ID and a teardown for the controller SoC part number.'
  software:
    - 'esp32-classic-bt-scan firmware (BR/EDR inquiry) or esp32-bt-exp (dual-mode discovery dump); an FCC-ID / teardown lookup for the chipset.'
  signal:
    freq: '2.402 to 2.480 GHz (79 RF channels × 1 MHz, adaptive frequency hopping ~1600 hops/s)'
    bandwidth: '1 MHz per RF channel'
    modulation: 'GFSK 1 Mbps (Basic Rate); π/4-DQPSK 2 Mbps & 8DPSK 3 Mbps (EDR)'

    The control's own framing says the steps are "passive identification (an inquiry
    scan and label inspection, no pairing, no connection, no transmission beyond the
    standard inquiry the controller performs)". That sentence contradicts itself: an
    inquiry IS a transmission: the controller broadcasts the GIAC across 79 channels
    and waits for responses. Calling it passive because the controller does it for
    you does not make the antenna quieter.

## Mechanism

Before any RF work against a Bluetooth device, two questions decide everything that follows: **is this device even Bluetooth Classic (BR/EDR), and what silicon and stack run it?** Bluetooth Classic (BR/EDR) is a different PHY and MAC from Bluetooth Low Energy, it hops across 79 RF channels of 1 MHz at ~1600 hops/s with GFSK at 1 Mbps (Basic Rate) and π/4-DQPSK / 8DPSK at 2 to 3 Mbps (EDR), where BLE uses 40 channels and a different access scheme. The two share the 2.4 GHz band but **must never be conflated**: an ESP32-S3, nRF or CC-series target is usually LE-only and belongs on the BLE descent, while audio gear, HID peripherals, OBD-II dongles and car/infotainment modules are typically Classic or dual-mode. Confirming BR/EDR is therefore the first RF prerequisite this control owns.

A large share of real-world Bluetooth-Classic compromise is not a novel cryptographic break but an *unpatched* component carrying a known, named, CVE-tracked flaw. The flaw lives in one of three places, and identifying which is the whole point of this step:

- **The controller (the BR/EDR SoC / radio firmware).** BrakTooth is the canonical Classic example: a family of ~16 CVEs and 20+ variants found by directed fuzzing of the baseband and Link Manager Protocol (LMP), causing crashes, deadlocks and, on some chips, remote code execution across dozens of BR/EDR controllers [garbelini2022braktooth]. The public proof-of-concept runs on the same cheap ESP32 used here [braktooth-repo]. This is a controller-vulnerability case under BSAM-IG-02.
- **The host stack (the OS Bluetooth implementation).** BlueBorne is the canonical Classic example: a stack overflow in L2CAP configuration-response processing in the Linux BlueZ native stack (kernel 2.6.32 up to and including 4.13.1) yields kernel-space remote code execution over the air, with no pairing and no user interaction (CVE-2017-1000251) [cve-2017-1000251][armis2017blueborne]. This is a host-stack-vulnerability case under BSAM-IG-03.
- **The standard itself**, independent of any one chip. KNOB downgrades BR/EDR encryption-key entropy to as little as one byte during negotiation, making the session key brute-forceable (CVE-2019-9506) [antonioli2019knob][cve-2019-9506]. BIAS impersonates a previously-paired BR/EDR device by completing authentication without the link key (CVE-2020-10135, Core Specification v5.2 and earlier) [antonioli2020bias][cve-2020-10135]; the two chain naturally, downgrade with KNOB, then impersonate with BIAS. These are standard-vulnerability cases under BSAM-IG-04.

BSAM already provides mature, dedicated controls for exactly this triage: controller vulnerabilities (BSAM-IG-02), host-stack vulnerabilities (BSAM-IG-03), and standard vulnerabilities (BSAM-IG-04). **RFSAM does not re-derive them.** This control exists to place the step in the RF assessment flow and to supply the one thing the RF assessor is best positioned to produce: confirmation that the device is BR/EDR, and its BD_ADDR (48-bit, with the upper 24 bits an OUI/vendor hint) and Class of Device read straight from an inquiry response, the component-inventory seed the BSAM controls consume. The named corpus above (BlueBorne, KNOB, BIAS, BrakTooth) is **representative, not exhaustive**, it dates fast, so always check current vendor advisories and the Bluetooth SIG erratum feed against the components you actually identify.

## Procedure

> Steps below are passive identification (an inquiry scan and label inspection, no pairing, no connection, no transmission beyond the standard inquiry the controller performs). Run them only against devices you are authorised to assess.

1. **Read the silicon off the label / FCC ID.** Find the FCC ID on the device and look it up; the internal photos and test report usually name the module or controller SoC.
   ```bash
   # Open the FCC ID search and enter the grantee + product code from the label
   xdg-open "https://fccid.io/"
   ```
   Expected: the module/chip part number (for example a CSR/Qualcomm, Cypress, Espressif, Realtek or Texas Instruments BR/EDR part), which maps directly onto the BSAM-IG-02 controller-vulnerability lookup.

2. **Confirm BR/EDR and capture BD_ADDR + Class of Device with an inquiry scan.** Flash the BR/EDR inquiry firmware to an *original* ESP32 (DevKit) and run a Classic inquiry, this uses the ESP32's own Bluetooth controller, the cheapest accessible way to enumerate Classic devices in range (RFSAM-RES-26).
   ```bash
   # esp32-classic-bt-scan: BR/EDR inquiry on the ESP32's own controller
   esptool.py --chip esp32 write_flash 0x0 esp32-classic-bt-scan.bin
   # then open the serial monitor at 115200 baud to read the inquiry results
   ```
   Expected (per discoverable device): a `BD_ADDR`, friendly name, RSSI and a `Class of Device` (CoD). A device answering this BR/EDR inquiry is, by definition, Classic-capable, that is the confirmation this control needs. The 48-bit BD_ADDR's upper 24 bits are an OUI you can resolve to a vendor; the CoD's major/minor fields hint at the device type (audio, peripheral, phone). A device that never answers a Classic inquiry but does answer a BLE scan is LE-only, send it to the BLE descent (RFSAM-BLE-IG-01).

3. **Disambiguate dual-mode when a target could be either.** If the device might expose both radios, bring up the dual-mode discovery dump (`esp32-bt-exp`) to list what it sees on Classic (inquiry) and BLE at once.
   ```bash
   # esp32-bt-exp: Bluedroid dual-mode discovery dump (Classic + BLE survey)
   esptool.py --chip esp32 write_flash 0x0 esp32-bt-exp.bin
   ```
   Expected: a combined survey. A device appearing in *both* the Classic and BLE lists is dual-mode (BR/EDR + LE), note this, because the two radios are assessed on different descents and a finding on one does not imply the other.

4. **Infer the controller / host-stack / spec-version tuple.** Combine the BD_ADDR OUI and CoD from step 2 with the FCC-ID/teardown part number from step 1, and with the host behind the device where known (a phone or Linux gateway implies its stack, for example Android Fluoride, Linux BlueZ). The Core-Spec version it claims bounds the spec-level corpus (KNOB ≤ 5.1; BIAS ≤ 5.2).
   Expected: a `(controller SoC, host stack, Core-Spec version)` tuple, the input the BSAM-IG controls need.

5. **Run the BSAM Information-Gathering controls against the identified components.** This is where the judgement is made; RFSAM hands off here.
   - **BSAM-IG-02**, controller vulnerabilities (for example BrakTooth against the identified BR/EDR SoC).
   - **BSAM-IG-03**, host-stack vulnerabilities (for example BlueBorne against the identified native stack).
   - **BSAM-IG-04**, standard vulnerabilities (for example KNOB / BIAS against the claimed Core-Spec version).

6. **Carry the result forward as scoping input** to the RFSAM SP/PHY/LL capture controls. An end-of-life, unpatchable controller with a published BrakTooth RCE may make further dynamic RF testing moot, that finding is already decisive.

## Field case

Illustrative walkthrough, substitute the values you capture. The target is a Bluetooth-Classic hands-free car module:

- **Step 1 (label):** the FCC ID's internal photos showed a [FILL: controller SoC part number read from the FCC internal photos / teardown], placing the controller on the BSAM-IG-02 lookup.
- **Step 2 (air):** the `esp32-classic-bt-scan` inquiry returned the unit answering a BR/EDR inquiry, confirming Classic, not LE-only, with `BD_ADDR [FILL: 48-bit address from the inquiry response]`, a friendly name matching the head unit, and a Class of Device with the Audio major class set. The BD_ADDR's upper-24-bit OUI resolved to the module vendor, consistent with the label.
- **Step 3 (dual-mode):** `esp32-bt-exp` showed the same unit on the Classic list only and not on BLE, a Classic-only target, so the assessment stays on the BR/EDR descent.
- **Step 5 (BSAM):** running BSAM-IG-02/IG-04 against the identified controller and its claimed Core-Spec version is the decisive step. If the controller predates the vendor's BrakTooth fix, the unit is exposed to the relevant baseband/LMP crash-or-RCE variant regardless of how strong the pairing *looks*; if it claims Core Spec ≤ 5.1, KNOB applies at the standard level.

The value RFSAM adds here is sequencing, not a new finding: the cheap inquiry-scan component inventory from this step scopes which SP/PHY/LL capture controls are worth running at all. The `[FILL: …]` placeholders (controller part number, BD_ADDR) are intentional, replace them only with values actually read from a device before claiming a specific finding.

## Remediation

**Developer (device firmware / controller integration).** Track your BR/EDR controller vendor's advisory feed and the Bluetooth SIG erratum feed; ship the controller-firmware fixes for the named flaws (BrakTooth baseband/LMP) [garbelini2022braktooth]. Reject low encryption-key entropy to defeat KNOB-style downgrade and set a high minimum key size [antonioli2019knob][cve-2019-9506]. Enforce mutual re-authentication that re-derives the link key, closing the BIAS impersonation class [antonioli2020bias][cve-2020-10135]. Do not select an end-of-life BR/EDR controller with no patch path for a new design.

**Integrator (host / OS stack).** Keep the host Bluetooth stack patched, BlueBorne (CVE-2017-1000251) is a kernel/BlueZ fix, so patch the kernel, not just the application [cve-2017-1000251]. Disable BR/EDR discoverability and Classic profiles that are not in use, shrinking the inquiry-visible surface this control fingerprints.

**Operator (deployment / fleet).** Maintain a per-device component inventory (controller SoC + host stack + Core-Spec version) keyed off the BD_ADDR, so a newly published Classic CVE can be matched to the fleet quickly. Treat any controller that is end-of-life with no patch path as high-risk and plan replacement. Follow the remediation of the cited BSAM Information-Gathering controls (BSAM-IG-02/03/04), which own the formal judgement this control defers to.

title: Survey the 802.15.4 channels and confirm capture feasibility
protocol: ZIGBEE
layer: SP
criticality: info
applicability:
  - Zigbee
  - IEEE 802.15.4
deferred: false
objective: >-
  Determine which 802.15.4 channel(s) carry the target PAN and whether that PAN
  can be observed from the assessment position, i.e. confirm the channel, PAN ID
  and a usable signal before committing a capture radio to the link layer.
intro: >-
  A 2.4 GHz Zigbee PAN is pinned to one of sixteen fixed 802.15.4 channels and
  stays there, it does not frequency-hop. The Spectrum-layer job is therefore a
  channel scan, not a hop chase: find the channel the network lives on, read its
  PAN ID, and judge whether the signal is strong and clean enough (against heavy
  Wi-Fi overlap in this band) to capture. This control is observational; it
  establishes capture feasibility before any link-layer work.
prerequisites:
  hardware:
    - 'An 802.15.4 capture radio for the channel/energy scan: CatSniffer (CC1352), nRF52840 dongle, TI CC2531, or an Electronic Cats Minino (ESP32-C6, standalone)'
    - 'Optionally a wideband SDR (HackRF One / bladeRF 2.0 micro) for a coarse spectrum/waterfall cross-check'
  software:
    - 'A channel/PAN scanner: KillerBee (zbstumbler, active) or Kismet (passive 802.15.4 survey); catnip cativity on a CatSniffer; gqrx for the SDR waterfall'
  signal:
    freq: '2.4 GHz: 16 channels 11 to 26, centre Fc = 2405 + 5(k−11) MHz (2405 to 2480 MHz), spaced 5 MHz'
    bandwidth: '~2 MHz occupied per channel'
    modulation: 'IEEE 802.15.4 O-QPSK with DSSS, 250 kbps (2.4 GHz PHY)'
  skill: beginner
attacks:
  - name: Active network discovery (beacon-request scan)
    refs:
      - killerbee
      - ieee802154-2020
    impact: >-
      Enumerates reachable PANs, channel, 16-bit PAN ID and stack/profile hints,
      without joining or decrypting; the reconnaissance that precedes any capture
      or attack, not an exploit in itself.
    preconditions: >-
      A transmit-capable 802.15.4 radio within range of the PAN; the network's
      devices answer a MAC beacon request (the default behaviour of a
      beacon-enabled or association-permitting coordinator).
    summary: >-
      zbstumbler walks the channels transmitting 802.15.4 beacon requests and
      logs the PANs that answer (PAN ID, channel, stack profile), an active scan
      that locates the network fast. Because it transmits, prefer a passive
      energy/Kismet sweep where stealth or non-interference matters.

## Mechanism

A 2.4 GHz Zigbee PAN operates on a single IEEE 802.15.4 channel and stays there for the life of the network, unlike BLE, it does not frequency-hop across the band [ieee802154-2020]. The 2.4 GHz PHY defines sixteen channels numbered 11 to 26, spaced 5 MHz apart, with channel `k` centred at `Fc = 2405 + 5(k − 11)` MHz, i.e. 2405 MHz (ch 11) to 2480 MHz (ch 26), each occupying roughly 2 MHz, modulated as O-QPSK with DSSS at 250 kbps [ieee802154-2020]. Because the PAN is pinned to one channel, the Spectrum-layer task is a channel scan to find that channel and read the PAN's identity, not a hop chase.

There are two ways to find the channel, and they differ in whether they transmit. An **active scan** sends a MAC beacon request on each channel and records the beacons that answer, yielding the channel, the 16-bit PAN ID and stack/profile hints in seconds; KillerBee's `zbstumbler` is the canonical implementation, walking the channels and logging every PAN that responds [killerbee]. Active scanning is defined by the standard as the coordinator/device discovery primitive [ieee802154-2020], but it is observable to anyone listening and perturbs the network. A **passive survey** instead listens only, an energy/ED-style sweep or a frame-logging channel hop that never sends a beacon request. Kismet channel-hops the 802.15.4 band and logs every PAN, coordinator and device it hears to pcapng without transmitting [kismet]; on a CatSniffer, catnip's `cativity` mode draws a live per-channel activity table and can map coordinator/router/end-device topology [catsniffer-tools]. A wideband SDR waterfall (gqrx) is only a coarse cross-check: it shows energy, not Zigbee frames, and cannot by itself tell Zigbee from Wi-Fi or BLE in the shared band.

Capture feasibility is dominated by Wi-Fi coexistence: 802.15.4 shares 2.4 GHz with 802.11, whose ~20 MHz channels overlap several Zigbee channels at once, so a target on a Wi-Fi-congested channel may be hard to capture cleanly. AN1017 frames the defence as *frequency separation*, place the 802.15.4 channel as far as possible from the Wi-Fi channel, ideally at the opposite end of the 2.4 GHz ISM band, because adjacent-channel performance can be up to 20 dB worse than the "far-away" case [silabs-an1017]. The non-overlapping Wi-Fi channels 1/6/11 occupy the same frequencies as Zigbee channels 11 to 22 [metageek-coex], so practitioners commonly place a PAN on a higher channel above that traffic; the non-overlapping Zigbee channels 15, 20, 25 and 26 sit in the gaps outside almost all standard Wi-Fi settings and are the common choices [haade-zigbee-channels], with channel 26 often the least Wi-Fi-affected but supported by fewer devices. Note a North-American regulatory constraint: AN1017 states Zigbee channels 25 and 26 require reduced transmit power to meet FCC requirements [silabs-an1017].

## Procedure

> Authorised testing only. Step 1 (active scan) transmits 802.15.4 beacon requests into the RF environment; run it only against networks you are authorised to assess, ideally in an RF-shielded setup or with explicit permission. Where stealth or non-interference is required, skip to the passive survey in step 2.

1. **Active scan, find the channel and PAN ID fast (transmits).** Walk the 16 channels with KillerBee, sending beacon requests and logging responders:
   ```bash
   zbstumbler
   ```
   Expected output: one line per discovered PAN, e.g. `New Network: PANID 0x1A62 Source 0x0000 Ext PANID ... Channel 15 Stack Profile: ZigBee PRO`. Record the **Channel** and **PANID** of the target, that is the channel you will park a capture radio on. No responders on any channel means the network is out of range, on a non-default channel set, or not answering beacon requests (try the passive survey).

2. **Passive survey, confirm without transmitting.** Channel-hop and log every PAN/device heard, sending nothing:
   ```bash
   kismet -c nrf52840.0:name=zigbee
   ```
   (Substitute your 802.15.4 datasource; a CatSniffer v3 Zigbee source is specified manually as a serial port.) Expected: Kismet's UI lists 802.15.4 devices/PANs with their channel as it hops, and writes a `.kismet`/pcapng log. Cross-check the channel and PAN ID against step 1; a passive hit on the same channel confirms the PAN is observable from your position.

3. **CatSniffer: per-channel activity and topology (CatSniffer kit).** On a CatSniffer, see which channel is busy at a glance and optionally map the mesh:
   ```bash
   python3 catnip.py cativity
   python3 catnip.py cativity --channel 15 --topology --protocol zigbee
   ```
   Expected: a live per-channel activity table (default mode) highlighting the busy channel, then a fixed-channel detail view and a coordinator/router/end-device topology for the chosen channel.

4. **SDR waterfall, coarse spectrum cross-check (optional).** Tune an SDR to the target channel's centre to judge signal strength and Wi-Fi overlap before committing:
   ```bash
   gqrx
   ```
   Tune to `Fc = 2405 + 5(k − 11)` MHz for channel `k` (e.g. 2425 MHz for channel 15). Expected: a ~2 MHz Zigbee burst pattern at the channel centre, often beside much wider Wi-Fi energy. This only confirms energy is present, it does not decode frames; use steps 1 to 3 to confirm it is Zigbee.

5. **Record feasibility.** Note channel, PAN ID, observed signal level and the Wi-Fi overlap. This is the hand-off to the LL-layer capture control: the channel to park on and whether capture is clean or contended.

## Field case

Passive survey (step 2) run on 2026-08-26 in the Electronic Cats lab, indoors, using Kismet with a CatSniffer as the 802.15.4 datasource and a rigid omnidirectional antenna on its SMA port. Kismet logged the session to `Kismet-20260826-15-26-18-1.kismet`. The survey transmitted nothing.

Over 167 s (15:26:34 to 15:29:21) Kismet recorded 23 frames, every one of them on channel 25 (2475 MHz, which matches `Fc = 2405 + 5(k - 11)` from step 4):

- 14 frames carried addresses. They came from two nodes, listed by Kismet as `00:01` and `52:5A`: 8 frames exchanged between the two nodes (4 in each direction) and 6 frames sent to the broadcast address `FF:FF` (3 from each node).
- 9 frames carried no address in the Kismet log: eight of 33 bytes and one of 239 bytes.
- Per-frame signal ranged from -87 dBm to -62 dBm, with a mean of -70.2 dBm over the 23 frames. The per-node peak reported by Kismet was -64 dBm for both nodes.

Kismet's device list shows three entries because it lists the broadcast address `FF:FF` as a device. The number of transmitting nodes observed is two.

Feasibility record (step 5): the network is on channel 25 and both nodes were received at a -64 dBm peak throughout a 167 s window, so a capture radio parked on channel 25 is the hand-off to the LL capture control. Two items of the record were not measured in this session and stay open for this site: the PAN ID, and the Wi-Fi overlap (no SDR waterfall was taken, step 4).

## Remediation

Channel survey is reconnaissance; "remediation" here is reducing the exposure and interference it depends on, layered by role.

- **Developer / stack vendor:** Do not leak network identity before encryption is in force. The channel and PAN ID are inherently observable (they are layer-1/MAC), so the defence is to ensure nothing of value is readable from beacons or pre-join traffic, and to support install-code / Zigbee 3.0 joining so that locating the network does not advance an attacker toward the key (see the CR-layer control).
- **Integrator:** Choose a channel deliberately. Maximizing frequency separation from local Wi-Fi improves reliability [silabs-an1017], and placing the PAN on a higher channel above the common Wi-Fi traffic (e.g. 15/20/25/26) is the usual channel-planning advice [haade-zigbee-channels], which incidentally also makes the network easier to capture cleanly, so weigh coexistence against exposure, and prefer install-code joining so a located PAN is not a joinable one. Avoid the well-known default Trust Center link key.
- **Operator:** Treat the RF environment as observable. A surveyable, fixed-channel PAN is normal and cannot be hidden; monitor for anomalous beacon-request floods or unexpected rejoin activity (signs of active scanning/disruption) and ensure devices that briefly expose identifiers (e.g. at join) do so only during controlled commissioning, not continuously.

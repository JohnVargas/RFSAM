title: Demodulate the air and recover link-layer bits
protocol: BLE
layer: PHY
criticality: info
applicability:
  - BLE
deferred: false
objective: >-
  Verify that the toolchain can demodulate the BLE GFSK waveform and recover
  clean link-layer bits, correlating the access address, de-whitening the PDU,
  and validating the CRC, for the target's PHY (LE 1M / 2M / Coded), either on a
  dedicated radio or by channelising a wideband SDR capture.
intro: >-
  Everything above the air starts here: a BLE frame is GFSK, prefixed by a known
  preamble and a 32-bit access address, with its PDU and CRC whitened by a
  channel-seeded LFSR. This control checks that you can turn the RF into correct
  bits, find the access address, de-whiten, and pass CRC, because every
  link-layer, crypto and attack control for BLE depends on clean per-channel bits.
prerequisites:
  hardware:
    - 'A dedicated BLE sniffer that demodulates on-chip: a CC1352-class board for Sniffle (CatSniffer), an nRF52840 dongle (nRF Sniffer), or an Ubertooth One'
    - 'Or a wideband SDR for the channelised path: HackRF One (~20 MHz), bladeRF 2.0 micro (full 80 MHz in oversampling), or USRP B210'
  software:
    - 'Sniffle, nRF Sniffer, or Ubertooth host tools for the on-chip path; ice9-bluetooth-sniffer for the SDR path; Wireshark to read the decoded frames'
  signal:
    freq: '2.402 to 2.480 GHz (40 × 2 MHz channels: 3 advertising 37/38/39 + 37 data)'
    bandwidth: '2 MHz per channel (80 MHz full band)'
    modulation: 'GFSK (BT = 0.5, ~250 kHz deviation); PHYs LE 1M (1 Mbps), LE 2M, LE Coded'
  skill: intermediate

    impact: >-
      Lets a passive listener identify and follow an already-established,
      unencrypted connection it never saw set up, the bit-recovery prerequisite
      for downstream sniffing, decryption and injection.
    preconditions: >-
      Reception of data-channel packets from a live connection; no key needed
      because whitening and CRC use publicly known, channel-derived seeds.
    summary: >-
      Treats any candidate 32 bits following a preamble-like pattern as a possible
      access address, then recovers CRCInit by running the over-the-air CRC back
      through the reversible CRC LFSR, recovering the parameters needed to lock
      onto a connection from raw demodulated bits alone.

    refs:

    impact: >-
      Crashes, deadlocks, buffer overflows or security bypass on vulnerable BLE
      SoCs, triggered by an in-range attacker.
    preconditions: >-
      An in-range central that can put crafted link-layer frames on the air to a
      target peripheral, which presupposes exactly the demodulation /
      bit-recovery capability this control verifies.
    summary: >-
      Set of 11 new vulnerabilities (13 CVE IDs) reported across BLE stacks from
      several SoC vendors, found by a central-device fuzzer that connects to a
      peripheral and sends malformed link-layer / Security Manager packets, or
      well-formed packets at the wrong protocol state, mutating every frame
      field; cited here only as evidence that PHY-layer bit control is the
      precondition for the link-layer findings BSAM then assesses.

    Both paths receive. Sniffle is invoked with -a (advertising capture) and with
    -m to follow a given address, neither of which scans actively; the SDR path
    channelises captured I/Q. Worth stating explicitly because step 3's
    "follows the connection" reads like participation and is not. device-access
    because the pass condition needs frames on a data channel, and that requires
    somebody to make the bench device connect during the capture window.

## Mechanism

A BLE link-layer packet is sent as a GFSK waveform: the Gaussian-filtered FSK
keys the symbol with roughly ±250 kHz deviation and BT = 0.5 over a 1 µs symbol
on the LE 1M PHY [[ryan2013woot]][[btcorespec54]]. Demodulation is therefore
an FM/frequency-discriminator step, the sign of the instantaneous frequency
offset is the bit, followed by clock recovery to slice symbols. Sniffers do
this on a dedicated radio's modem (the Ubertooth's CC2400 is configured to
demodulate GFSK at the BLE deviation [[ryan2013woot]]); the SDR path instead
channelises a wide capture, then FM-demodulates each 2 MHz channel in software
[[ice9repo]].

Recovering *bits* is not the same as recovering *frames*. Every packet starts
with an 8-bit alternating preamble, then a 32-bit **access address** (AA), then
the PDU and a 24-bit CRC [[ryan2013woot]][[btcorespec54]]. On the three
advertising channels the AA is the fixed constant `0x8e89bed6`, so a demodulator
finds packet boundaries by correlating against that known 32-bit value
[[ryan2013woot]][[ble-primer]]. The PDU and CRC are then **whitened**, XORed
with the output of a 7-bit LFSR (taps at bits 4 and 7) whose seed is derived
from the channel index alone, with no key involved; because the seed and LFSR
are public, de-whitening "does not complicate sniffing" [[ryan2013woot]][[btcorespec54]].
A correct frame is confirmed when the de-whitened CRC, computed with the
connection's CRCInit, matches.

For a connection the auditor never saw set up, the AA is a per-connection random
value and not known in advance. Ryan's method treats any 32 bits following a
preamble-like transition as a *candidate* AA, then recovers the connection's
CRCInit by feeding the over-the-air CRC backwards through the CRC LFSR, which is
reversible, the same reversibility Spill and Bittau noted for classic Bluetooth
holds for the BLE CRC [[ryan2013woot]]. This is what lets a passive listener lock
onto and follow an already-established connection from raw bits, and it is the
PHY-layer prerequisite for the connection-following described in RFSAM-RES-02.

Why this control sits at PHY and matters on its own: bit recovery is the floor
the rest of the stack stands on. Link-layer fuzzers such as SweynTooth drive a
central that connects to the target peripheral and then sends malformed
link-layer (and Security Manager) packets, or well-formed packets at the wrong
protocol state, mutating every field of the over-the-air frame, and putting
crafted bits on the air presupposes exactly the demodulate/de-whiten/CRC
capability verified here [[garbelini2020sweyntooth]].
RFSAM owns the spectrum and signal/PHY floors for BLE; the link-layer and
above (frame semantics, injection, key recovery) are assessed under Tarlogic's
BSAM. This control deliberately stops at "can you recover correct bits", which is
why its criticality is observational (`info`) rather than an exploit.

## Procedure

Run all capture against your own test devices, in an authorised environment.
Passive demodulation is observational, but treat the spectrum as in-scope only
where you have permission.

1. **Pick the path.** On-chip demodulation (Sniffle / nRF Sniffer / Ubertooth)
   is simplest and recovers bits the radio's modem already sliced; the SDR path
   (ice9) channelises a wideband capture and demodulates in software, and is the
   only path that can grab an *already-established* connection (RFSAM-RES-01,
   RFSAM-RES-02, RFSAM-RES-03).

2. **On-chip path, capture and confirm bit recovery with Sniffle.** Scan the
   advertising channels (passive, `-a` = don't follow connections) and write a
   PCAP for Wireshark:
   ```bash
   ./sniff_receiver.py -s /dev/ttyACM0 -a -o adv.pcap
   ```
   Expected: a live table of advertisements; each captured packet that
   Wireshark dissects (AA `0x8e89bed6`, an `ADV_IND`/`ADV_EXT_IND` PDU, and
   `CRC: ... [correct]`) is proof the chain demodulate → AA-correlate →
   de-whiten → CRC succeeded. A flood of frames with `CRC incorrect` means the
   PHY/sync is wrong (wrong PHY selected, or signal too weak); add `-C` to also
   capture CRC-error packets when diagnosing this.

3. **On-chip path, verify on a non-advertising / data channel.** Drop the `-a`
   flag so Sniffle follows the connection (following is its default) and confirm
   it decodes data PDUs on channels other than 37/38/39, this exercises the
   per-channel whitening seed and the per-connection AA/CRCInit, not just the
   fixed advertising constants. Filter to the target advertiser's MAC to lock on:
   ```bash
   ./sniff_receiver.py -s /dev/ttyACM0 -m 12:34:56:78:9A:BC -o conn.pcap
   ```
   Expected: `LL Data` PDUs with `CRC ... [correct]` on data-channel indices.
   Read the connection's AA and CRCInit from the `CONNECT_IND` in Wireshark.

4. **SDR path, channelise and demodulate the whole band.** Capture / stream the
   band and let ice9 split it into 2 MHz channels, FM-demodulate each, and write
   an all-channel PCAP:
   ```bash
   ice9-bluetooth -l -i bladerf0 -a -w all_channels.pcap
   ```
   Expected: per-channel BLE frames in `all_channels.pcap` openable in Wireshark.
   The channelizer is the bottleneck, start narrow (e.g. 20 channels) and widen
   only while no overflow/dropped-sample is reported [[ice9repo]] (RFSAM-RES-03).
   Garbage / "random bytes" decoded instead of frames indicates the demod or
   sample rate is mismatched, per the tool's own troubleshooting note.

5. **Pass/fail.** The control passes if at least one path yields frames marked
   `CRC correct` for the target's PHY on both an advertising and a data channel,
   with no sustained sample-loss. If only advertising decodes and the SDR path
   overflows at full band, declare connection-following out of scope (RFSAM-RES-02)
   rather than reporting false negatives.

## Field case

Illustrative walkthrough, substitute the values you capture. Capturing a BLE
light controller's advertising on channel 37 with a CatSniffer running Sniffle,
Wireshark dissects the `ADV_IND` with the fixed advertising access address
`0x8e89bed6` and `CRC ... [correct]`, confirming the demodulate → AA-correlate
→ de-whiten → CRC chain on the radio's own modem. The useful detail is the
de-whitening: the PDU bytes are only legible after the channel-37 whitening seed
is removed, and because that seed is derived from the channel index, not a key,
the same capture is readable by any sniffer, which is precisely why passive BLE
sniffing is feasible at all [[ryan2013woot]].

On the SDR path, splitting the 80 MHz band into 40 × 2 MHz channels on a
HackRF/bladeRF and FM-demodulating each is where the cost shows: ice9's
channelizer is the stated bottleneck, so start the run at 20 channels and widen
while watching for dropped samples. A naive full-band attempt on an underpowered
host decodes "a bunch of random bytes" rather than frames, the tool's own symptom
of a demod/rate mismatch [[ice9repo]]. The sensitivity margin, how many dB below
a clean capture the channelised SDR path still recovers frames, is bench-specific:
[FILL: measured dB margin from a controlled bench capture].

## Remediation

Bit recovery at PHY is an inherent, public property of the BLE waveform, the
GFSK parameters, the advertising access address, the whitening seeds and the CRC
are all in the open specification, so there is no PHY-layer "fix" that hides the
bits from a competent receiver [[ryan2013woot]][[btcorespec54]]. Remediation
therefore lives above the recovered bits:

- **Developer:** never treat the link as confidential at the PHY/LL level. Enable
  LE encryption (LE Secure Connections, ECDH pairing) so that even a perfectly
  demodulated, de-whitened, CRC-valid PDU yields ciphertext, not plaintext, above
  the link layer. Validate and bounds-check all link-layer inputs: the SweynTooth
  class shows that malformed-but-CRC-valid frames crash unhardened SoC stacks
  [[garbelini2020sweyntooth]].
- **Integrator:** select SoCs/stacks with current firmware that patch the
  SweynTooth-class link-layer parsing bugs, and verify the device rejects
  unencrypted access to anything sensitive, bit recovery on the air should never
  translate into readable application data.
- **Operator:** assume any in-range party can recover and read unencrypted BLE
  bits; for sensitive deployments, test in an RF-shielded environment and treat
  on-air observability as a given, not a control.

title: Inventory identity and configuration exposed on the broadcast channels
protocol: NR5G
layer: LL
criticality: medium
applicability:
  - 5G NR
  - 5G Standalone (SA)
  - 5G Non-Standalone (NSA)
deferred: false
objective: >-
  Determine, from a purely passive capture, which identity and configuration
  data a 5G NR cell exposes on its broadcast channels, cell configuration from
  the MIB (PBCH) and SIB1 (PLMN, cell identity, TAC), and the form of the
  subscriber's long-term identifier on the air, and confirm whether the
  subscriber identity is concealed as a SUCI (and under which protection scheme)
  or sent effectively in the clear via the null-scheme.
intro: >-
  5G broadcasts its cell configuration (MIB, SIB1) in the clear, exactly as LTE
  does, but improves on the subscriber-identity exposure: the long-term identity
  (SUPI/IMSI) is concealed as a SUCI before it leaves the device. This control
  inventories what the broadcast channels actually expose, cell identity and
  tracking-area configuration that remain in the clear, and whether the SUCI is
  genuinely encrypted or falls back to the null-scheme that re-opens the
  LTE-style permanent-identity leak.
prerequisites:
  hardware:
    - 'A coherent, ideally GPSDO-disciplined SDR for clean CP-OFDM grid recovery: USRP B210 (preferred), bladeRF 2.0 micro, or SignalSDR Pro; FR1 sub-6 GHz only (FR2 mmWave ~24 to 52 GHz is out of reach of these tuners)'
    - 'Or, the no-SDR route: a Qualcomm-based 5G modem exposing the DIAG interface (e.g. Quectel RM500Q) with a registered/test SIM, read passively with QCSuper'
  software:
    - '5GSniffer (passive PDCCH/DCI blind decoder), or Sni5Gect (research MAC-NR over-the-air sniffer); srsRAN Project to stand up a controlled SA cell when no turnkey passive SA receiver exists; QCSuper for the modem DIAG route; Wireshark for MAC-NR / NGAP / NAS-5GS dissection'
  signal:
    freq: 'Licensed cellular FR1 ~410 MHz to 7.125 GHz (common bands n1/2100, n3/1800, n78/3.5 GHz TDD, n28/700); the NR-ARFCN/band must be known first'
    bandwidth: 'Flexible numerology, subcarrier spacing 15·2^μ kHz (15/30/60/120 kHz); a carrier reaches up to 100 MHz in FR1, wider than a single HackRF (~20 MHz) or B210 (~56 MHz) view'
    modulation: 'CP-OFDM downlink and uplink (uplink may also use DFT-s-OFDM); QPSK/16/64/256-QAM. PSS/SSS in the SS/PBCH block (SSB) → PCI = 3·N_ID(1) + N_ID(2) (0 to 1007)'

  - name: SUCI-catcher (null-scheme exposure and AKA-based linkability)
    refs:

    impact: >-
      Where the operator deploys the null-scheme (or has not provisioned the
      home-network public key), the SUPI/IMSI is transmitted effectively in the
      clear, reinstating an LTE-style permanent-identity harvest off the air.
      Even with proper ECIES concealment, captured SUCIs can be linked across
      sessions by abusing the AKA procedure, re-enabling targeted tracking.
    preconditions: >-
      Radio proximity and a receiver that recovers the grid and reads the
      registration exchange; the cleartext-SUPI case additionally requires the
      operator/SIM to be configured for the null-scheme or to lack the
      provisioned public key.
    summary: >-
      The SUCI conceals the permanent identity in the common case, but the
      null-scheme fallback exposes the SUPI in the clear and the AKA procedure
      still permits linkability, so a 5G "SUCI-catcher" remains possible under
      specific conditions.
  - name: Unauthenticated broadcast trust (fake-cell / pre-authentication surface)
    refs:
      - hussain2019reasoner
      - bitsikas2022pws
    impact: >-
      Because the MIB/SIB broadcast and pre-authentication RRC/NAS messages carry
      no source authentication, a UE has no way to validate the configuration it
      reads on first contact, the foundation a rogue gNB stands on to drive
      registration/identity exchanges, downgrades, and warning-message
      spoofing/suppression.
    preconditions: >-
      The active exploitation belongs to the Attack layer and requires
      transmitting; this control only reads the unauthenticated broadcast to
      document the exposed surface it creates.
    summary: >-
      The broadcast configuration this control reads is unauthenticated by
      design; the same property is what makes the documented 5G pre-auth /
      fake-cell and PWS attacks feasible.

    Step 2 offers two routes. Route A reads the serving cell's signalling off a
    Qualcomm modem's DIAG interface and is genuinely passive. Route B stands up
    your own SA gNB, which radiates on licensed spectrum - T2, requiring an
    assignment, statutory authority, or containment. Because one documented route
    transmits, the control as a whole is requires_tx: true, which costs the
    passive route its place in a receive-only scope. Splitting step 2 into 2A
    (DIAG) and 2B (controlled cell) would let the passive majority of this control
    run under an observational mandate; recommended, not done here.

## Mechanism

5G NR carries everything on a CP-OFDM resource grid with flexible numerology (subcarrier spacing 15·2^μ kHz, a FR1 carrier up to 100 MHz wide; this control inherits those signal facts from the NR5G Wayfinder). Cell search starts at the **SS/PBCH block (SSB)**: PSS gives N_ID(2) (0 to 2), SSS gives N_ID(1) (0 to 335), and the Physical Cell ID is `PCI = 3·N_ID(1) + N_ID(2)` → 1008 IDs (0 to 1007). The **MIB**, carried on PBCH inside the SSB, gives the SFN, the SSB position and the SIB1 scheduling; **SIB1**, carried on PDSCH, gives the PLMN (MCC+MNC, i.e. the operator), the cell identity, the Tracking Area Code (TAC) and access information. As in LTE, these broadcast messages are sent in the clear, no confidentiality, integrity or source authentication, so a passive receiver that has recovered the grid reads the cell's full identity and configuration without ever transmitting.

The headline 5G improvement is at the subscriber-identity exposure, and it is the core of this control. In LTE the permanent identity (IMSI) could be harvested in the clear off the air; 5G conceals the long-term identity (SUPI) as a **SUCI** before it leaves the device, using ECIES public-key encryption against the home operator's public key, so only the operator's core can recover the permanent identity [nist2026suci]. 3GPP standardises three protection schemes: **Profile A** (Curve25519) and **Profile B** (secp256r1), both with AES-128-CTR and HMAC-SHA-256, and a **null-scheme** that performs no encryption at all [nist2026suci]. The null-scheme is used when the home network is configured to use it or has not provisioned the public key the UE needs to compute a SUCI, in which case the SUPI (the IMSI's MSIN) is transmitted effectively in the clear, reinstating the LTE-style permanent-identity leak. NIST's guidance is explicit that operators should enable SUCI and configure it with a non-null encryption scheme [nist2026suci]; verifying which scheme is actually in use on the air is exactly what this control checks.

Concealment is necessary but not sufficient. Chlosta et al. show a practical **5G SUCI-catcher** in a standalone network: beyond the null-scheme case, even properly ECIES-concealed SUCIs can be **linked across sessions** by abusing the Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) procedure, so an attacker can still confirm and track a target between encounters without ever recovering the cleartext SUPI [chlosta2021suci]. Separately, the broadcast and pre-authentication messages this control reads are **unauthenticated by design**, there is no source authentication on the MIB/SIB or on pre-auth RRC/NAS, which is the property that underpins the documented 5G fake-cell and protocol-flaw surface (5GReasoner's model-checking found new NAS/RRC design weaknesses including identity and tracking exposure [hussain2019reasoner], and the PWS work shows unauthenticated 5G warning broadcasts can be spoofed or suppressed [bitsikas2022pws]). Those active attacks belong to the Attack layer and require transmitting; here we only read the broadcast to inventory the exposure they build on.

The passive view is bounded the same way LTE's is. 5G-AKA derives the air-interface ciphering and integrity keys (NEA/NIA: SNOW 3G / AES / ZUC) from the secret on the USIM, shared only with the operator's core, so a passive capture yields no session key and no user-plane content, there is no weak-pairing shortcut. What passive decode yields is **configuration and identity-form exposure**: the cell's PLMN/identity/TAC, the PCI, and crucially *which* identity protection scheme the SUCI uses. Note also that passive 5G NR air-sniffing is markedly less mature than LTE, there is no drop-in passive SA receiver equivalent to srsUE's LTE cell search, so the practical routes (below) are a research PDCCH/MAC sniffer on a real cell, a controlled cell you stand up yourself, or the modem DIAG capture.

## Procedure

> Authorised testing only. The passive read steps below do not transmit, but you are receiving on licensed cellular spectrum, do so in line with local law and your engagement scope. Any step that stands up a cell (Step 2, alternative B) transmits in licensed spectrum and must be done on your own equipment, with a test SIM, inside RF shielding, under an authorised test licence, never radiate on a live operator's band.

1. **Confirm the target carrier first.** You must already know the band/NR-ARFCN and bandwidth (see RFSAM-RES-22 for the cellular identify-and-capture flow, and RFSAM-RES-09 for the disciplined-clock capture that OFDM grid recovery requires). Sanity-check on a waterfall that you are looking at a 5G downlink carrier and its SSB:
   ```bash
   gqrx
   ```
   Expected: a flat-topped CP-OFDM carrier (up to 100 MHz wide in FR1, so a single HackRF/B210 view shows only a slice, enough to locate the SSB) centred on the NR-ARFCN frequency. Note the centre frequency and the SSB.

2. **Recover the cell and read its broadcast identity.** Two routes, pick one:

   **(A) No-SDR modem route (fastest, fully passive).** Pull the serving cell's signalling off a Qualcomm modem's DIAG interface into Wireshark:
   ```bash
   ./qcsuper.py --usb-modem /dev/ttyUSB0 --wireshark-live
   ```
   Expected: a live GSMTAP PCAP in Wireshark; the modem reports the serving cell (band, NR-ARFCN, PLMN, cell identity) and the registration signalling. (5G frame support is modem/firmware-dependent.)

   **(B) Controlled-cell route, for studying cell search where no turnkey passive SA receiver exists.** Stand up your own SA gNB on an SDR with srsRAN Project behind a 5G core (Open5GS/free5GC) and a test UE, then read the SSB/MIB/SIB1 and NGAP end-to-end. (Radiates, authorised, RF-contained use only; the srsRAN_Project repo is archived, so take current builds from srsran.com.)

3. **Read the clear-text cell configuration** in Wireshark from whichever capture Step 2 produced. Filter `nr-rrc.SIB1` (and `nr-rrc.BCCH_BCH_Message` for the MIB). Expected: SIB1 shows the **PLMN (MCC+MNC = operator)**, the **cell identity** and the **TAC**, all in the clear, no decryption performed. Record them as the cell-configuration exposure.

4. **Observe the registration exchange and inventory the subscriber-identity form.** In the same capture, filter the NAS-5GS registration request (`nas-5gs.mm.type_id` / the Registration Request message) and inspect the **mobile identity IE**. Expected: a **SUCI** (the 5G-GUTI is used on re-registration; a fresh registration carries the SUCI). Read the SUCI's **Protection Scheme Identifier**:
   - `0` = **null-scheme** → the MSIN (the SUPI/IMSI body) is in the clear: a reportable permanent-identity exposure [nist2026suci][chlosta2021suci].
   - `1`/`2` = **Profile A / Profile B** → ECIES-concealed; the permanent identity is not recoverable from the capture, but record that SUCIs are still **linkable via the AKA procedure** [chlosta2021suci].
   This protection-scheme value is the headline finding of the control.

5. **(Optional) Passive control-channel view** with 5GSniffer to enumerate active RNTIs/DCIs from the PDCCH (a scheduling/activity inventory, FR1 FDD, research-grade, the current release recommends working from a recorded I/Q file):
   ```bash
   ./5g_sniffer config.toml
   ```
   Expected: a running list of decoded DCIs and the RNTIs active in the cell [5gsniffer-repo]. Sni5Gect gives an over-the-air MAC-NR view in Wireshark if you have the heavier USRP/host setup [sni5gect-repo].

6. **Inventory the result.** Record, as the control's finding, exactly what was recoverable purely passively: the cell PLMN/identity/TAC and PCI (broadcast, in the clear); and, the decisive item, whether the subscriber identity was concealed as a SUCI under Profile A/B (permanent identity protected, but linkable) or fell back to the **null-scheme** (permanent identity effectively in the clear). A null-scheme deployment is the headline exposure; a Profile A/B deployment downgrades the finding to configuration/metadata exposure plus AKA-linkability.

## Field case

Illustrative walkthrough, substitute the values you capture. This is a representative, reproducible procedure against an **authorised test cell** (your own srsRAN Project + Open5GS SA lab on a test NR-ARFCN inside RF shielding, or your own live subscription captured with operator permission via the QCSuper modem route), not a record of a measured engagement. No specific measured field finding is asserted below; every measured value is a `[FILL: …]` placeholder you replace with what you actually read off your own authorised capture.

- Step 1 to 2 located the n78 carrier and SSB and produced a Wireshark capture; the cell reported `PCI=[FILL: measured PCI]`.
- Step 3 read SIB1 in the clear: PLMN `[FILL: measured MCC-MNC]`, cell identity `[FILL: measured NCI]`, TAC `[FILL: measured TAC]`, no decryption performed.
- Step 4 inspected the NAS-5GS Registration Request mobile-identity IE and read the SUCI Protection Scheme Identifier as `[FILL: measured scheme id 0/1/2]`. In this lab the core was configured for `[FILL: null-scheme or Profile A/B]`:
  - If `[FILL: …]` = null-scheme, the MSIN `[FILL: measured/omit]` was visible in the clear, an LTE-style permanent-identity exposure that this control exists to catch [nist2026suci][chlosta2021suci].
  - If `[FILL: …]` = Profile A/B, the permanent identity was not recoverable; the reportable exposure is the in-the-clear cell configuration plus the documented AKA-based SUCI linkability [chlosta2021suci].

## Remediation

This is largely a standards/operator concern: in-the-clear broadcast configuration is inherent to the 5G air interface, so for most assessments the control *documents the exposure*; the one device/operator-actionable item is the SUCI protection scheme. Layered guidance:

- **Developer (UE / modem / SIM personalisation):** Ensure the USIM is provisioned with the home-network public key and a non-null protection scheme so the UE actually computes an ECIES-concealed SUCI; do not leak additional stable identifiers above the link that re-enable tracking once the 5G-GUTI rotates.
- **Integrator (network / operator):** Enable SUCI and configure it with a **non-null** encryption cipher scheme (Profile A or B), the explicit NIST recommendation [nist2026suci]; provision the home-network public key on subscriber SIMs; rotate the 5G-GUTI frequently to break the continuity a passive observer needs for tracking; minimise sensitive configuration broadcast in SIBs.
- **Operator / programme (defence-in-depth):** Treat the in-the-clear, unauthenticated broadcast as observable and plan accordingly, note that even with a non-null SUCI, captured identifiers remain linkable via the AKA procedure [chlosta2021suci], and that the unauthenticated broadcast/pre-auth surface is what underpins the documented fake-cell and PWS attacks [hussain2019reasoner][bitsikas2022pws]; deploy false-base-station / cell-site-simulator monitoring where the threat model warrants it.

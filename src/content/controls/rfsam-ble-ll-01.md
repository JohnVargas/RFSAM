title: Audit advertising and identifier exposure
protocol: BLE
layer: LL
criticality: medium
applicability:
  - BLE
deferred: true
objective: >-
  Determine, from passive capture alone, whether a device's advertising leaks
  identity- or product-bearing data (names, serials, service UUIDs, manufacturer
  data) or carries a stable/linkable identifier that defeats address
  randomisation and enables passive tracking.
intro: >-
  BLE advertising packets are transmitted in the clear and readable by any
  passive observer, no connection or pairing required. Manufacturer-specific
  data, device names, and service UUIDs frequently leak product identity, user
  identity, or trackable identifiers, and a non-rotating identifier in the
  payload can re-link a device across address changes. The link-layer judgement
  of what counts as over-exposure is BSAM's (BSAM-DI-03 / DI-04 / DI-06); RFSAM
  owns the RF-capture prerequisite, the passive advertising sweep that produces
  the beacons to inspect.
prerequisites:
  hardware:
    - 'A CC1352-class BLE sniffer (CatSniffer / any Sniffle-capable board), an nRF52840 dongle (nRF Sniffer), or an Ubertooth One, anything that captures the three advertising channels and exports a PCAP.'
  software:
    - 'Sniffle (or nRF Sniffer / Ubertooth), Wireshark for dissection, and optionally a host BLE stack (Bleak) for confirmatory enumeration.'
  signal:
    freq: '2.402 to 2.480 GHz (2.4 GHz ISM); advertising on channels 37 (2.402), 38 (2.426), 39 (2.480 GHz)'
    bandwidth: '2 MHz per channel'
    modulation: 'GFSK · LE 1M / 2M / Coded PHY'

    impact: >-
      Passive re-identification and location tracking of a device across its
      randomised-address changes, defeating the privacy goal of address
      randomisation.
    preconditions: >-
      The device advertises continuously and carries an identifying token in the
      advertising payload (e.g. manufacturer data or a stable GATT/service
      signature) that changes on a different schedule than the random address.
    summary: >-
      Exploits the asynchronous timing of address vs. payload change: an
      unchanged token in the payload re-links a new random address back to a
      known device, so randomisation alone does not prevent tracking.
  - name: Physical-layer fingerprint tracking
    refs:
      - givehchian2022physical
    impact: >-
      Tracking of a specific device by a per-radio hardware fingerprint, which no
      amount of address or payload hygiene removes, an exposure to flag even
      when the advertising content itself is clean.
    preconditions: >-
      Sustained capture of the device's transmissions with a capable receiver;
      the fingerprint can drift with temperature and may collide between devices,
      limiting reliability.
    summary: >-
      Fingerprints the unique physical-layer imperfections of a BLE transmitter
      (carrier/I-Q offsets across the whole packet, not just the preamble) to
      identify and track a device independent of its over-the-air identifiers.

    Steps 1-4 are passive: a Sniffle-class sniffer parked on the advertising
    channels, then offline dissection. Step 5 is not. `BleakScanner.discover()`
    is called without `scanning_mode`, and the default is an ACTIVE scan, so the
    host sends SCAN_REQ and solicits a response from every advertiser in range.
    The control's intro calls itself "passive and observational - no connection or
    transmission" and step 2 of the catnip route explicitly passes
    `--mode passive_scan`, so the contradiction is confined to step 5. Fixing it
    is one keyword: `BleakScanner.discover(scanning_mode="passive")` would make
    this control receive-only and observational again.

## Mechanism

BLE advertising is sent in the clear on three primary advertising channels, 37, 38 and 39 (2.402, 2.426 and 2.480 GHz), and any passive receiver can read it without a connection or pairing [bt-core-spec]. The advertising payload (AdvData) is a sequence of length-tagged AD structures: the complete/shortened Local Name, advertised Service UUIDs, and Manufacturer Specific Data (AD type `0xFF`, which begins with a 16-bit Company Identifier) are the common identity-bearing fields, all defined in the Bluetooth Assigned Numbers [bt-assigned-numbers]. Device names routinely embed a product model or a user-chosen label; manufacturer data may embed serials, MACs, or rotating-but-linkable tokens. This control captures advertisements and inventories every field for sensitive or identity-bearing content, the judgement of what is *too much* is owned by BSAM (BSAM-DI-03 generic naming, BSAM-DI-04 sensitive-data exposure).

Address randomisation is the BLE privacy mechanism intended to stop this leaking into trackability: a device using privacy advertises with a Resolvable Private Address (RPA) generated from an Identity Resolving Key, rotating it on a timer whose recommended default `RPA_Timeout` is 900 s / 15 minutes (a configurable parameter, not a hard requirement) [bt-rpa-timeout]. Two well-documented attack families defeat it. **Address-carryover tracking** (Becker et al.) exploits the fact that the random address and the payload change on different schedules: an identifying token left unchanged in the payload re-links a freshly rotated address back to a known device, so randomisation alone does not prevent tracking [becker2019tracking]. The authors observed this against Windows 10, iOS and macOS devices and some wearables; Android devices that do not continuously advertise were not affected [becker2019tracking]. **Physical-layer fingerprint tracking** (Givehchian et al.) goes a level deeper, identifying a device from the per-radio hardware imperfections in its transmissions, independent of any over-the-air identifier, though the fingerprint can drift with temperature and collide between devices, which limits reliability in the field [givehchian2022physical]. Even a payload that is clean by BSAM's content rules can therefore still be trackable; flag the physical-layer exposure where the threat model warrants it.

This control is **passive and observational**, capture and inventory only, no connection or transmission, so it carries no authorised-testing transmit step. It still requires authorisation to operate the radio in the target environment.

## Procedure

Passive capture only. No connection is opened and nothing is transmitted; you are reading advertisements that are already in the air.

1. Park a Sniffle-class sniffer on the advertising channels and capture to a PCAP (RFSAM-RES-04). Scanning mode hops 37/38/39 so you see each advertiser regardless of which channel it lands on:
   ```bash
   sniff_receiver.py -s /dev/ttyACM0 -o ble_adv.pcap
   ```
   Expected: a live table of advertisers with their address, address type (Public / Random Static / RPA), RSSI and advertising data. Let it run long enough to span at least one RPA-rotation interval (>= 15 min) if you want to observe rotation.

   CatSniffer-native path (Electronic Cats): the catnip CLI runs the same Sniffle capture on the CatSniffer and pipes it into Wireshark through the Sniffle extcap, so the sweep needs no separate host sniffer install:
   ```bash
   python catnip.py sniff ble --channel 37 --mode passive_scan --wireshark
   ```
   Expected: catnip flashes the Sniffle firmware if the board does not already have it, opens Wireshark on the "CatSniffer BLE" extcap interface, and advertising PDUs stream in live through the Sniffle dissector; save the capture from Wireshark to a `.pcap` for the inventory steps below. `--mode active_scan` additionally sends `SCAN_REQ`s to pull `SCAN_RSP` data (detectable). For BT5 extended-advertising or Coded-PHY advertisers, drop to `sniff_receiver.py` directly and add `-e -H` (extended) or `-l` (Coded PHY), since those flags are exposed by Sniffle rather than the catnip wrapper.

2. Open the capture in Wireshark and isolate advertising PDUs:
   ```
   btle.advertising_header.pdu_type == 0 || btle.advertising_header.pdu_type == 2 || btle.advertising_header.pdu_type == 6
   ```
   Expected: `ADV_IND` / `ADV_NONCONN_IND` / `ADV_SCAN_IND` frames. Inspect the dissected AD structures under *Bluetooth Low Energy Link Layer → Advertising Data*.

3. Inventory every AD structure for each advertiser, Local Name (`0x08`/`0x09`), Service UUIDs (`0x02` to `0x07`), and Manufacturer Specific Data (`0xFF`). Map the leading 16-bit Company Identifier in the `0xFF` data against the Bluetooth Assigned Numbers company list [bt-assigned-numbers].

4. Classify the advertising address type and watch for stability:
   - **Public** or **Random Static** address → a fixed, directly trackable identifier (a BSAM-DI-06 finding).
   - **RPA** → check whether it actually rotates over the capture window. An RPA that never changes is equivalent to a static address.
   - For any **rotating** RPA, scan the payloads for a token (serial, counter, name, or unique service-data blob) that *persists across* a rotation, that is the address-carryover linkage [becker2019tracking]. A simple way to surface candidates is to group frames by a stable payload field and see whether multiple distinct addresses share it:
   ```bash
   tshark -r ble_adv.pcap -Y "btle.advertising_header.pdu_type==0" \
     -T fields -e btle.advertising_address -e btcommon.eir_ad.entry.company_id \
     -e btcommon.eir_ad.entry.data | sort | uniq -c
   ```
   Expected: if one payload value appears under two or more advertising addresses, randomisation is being defeated by a carried-over token.

5. Flag every human-meaningful name, embedded serial/MAC, and non-rotating identifier as a candidate exposure, and hand the over-exposure judgement to the BSAM controls (BSAM-DI-03 / DI-04 / DI-06). Optionally confirm a name field with a host scan, still passive, no pairing:
   ```bash
   python3 -c "import asyncio;from bleak import BleakScanner;asyncio.run(BleakScanner.discover(timeout=10))"
   ```
   Expected: the same advertised names/manufacturer data seen by the sniffer, as a cross-check that the leak is observable from a commodity host (RFSAM-RES-04).

## Field case

Illustrative walkthrough, substitute the values you capture. In a passive sweep of an ordinary room, advertisers typically surface human-readable names that expose device class and ownership directly in the clear: a pet tracker advertising as `PwnPet_C81F`, an asset tracker as `TRKM_608015814_7795`, and several earbuds/wearables broadcasting model strings. No connection is made, the identity leak is in discovery alone.

The asset tracker is the instructive one for this control. Its advertised name `TRKM_608015814_7795` embeds what reads as a fixed serial/asset number; even if the device were to randomise its BLE address, that constant string in the Local Name AD structure re-links every rotation straight back to the same unit, the address-carryover linkage in concrete form [becker2019tracking]. Over a [FILL: capture-window length] window, record the tracker's advertising address as [FILL: address type, public / static / RPA, and whether it rotated], and confirm whether the `TRKM_…` name stays constant throughout: a constant Local Name spanning two or more distinct addresses is the carryover finding in the field.

## Remediation

Layered, since the leak originates in product firmware but is inherited by integrators and seen by operators.

- **Developer (device firmware):** Use a generic, non-identifying Local Name, no model, serial, owner label, or hostname in advertising data (BSAM-DI-03). Keep model/serial and any sensitive attributes behind an authenticated, encrypted connection, never in AdvData (BSAM-DI-04). Advertise with a **Resolvable Private Address** and confirm it actually rotates (default 900 s; consider the randomized-RPA-update feature to break timing predictability) [bt-rpa-timeout], and put **no** stable token, serial, counter, or unique service-data blob, in the payload, or the RPA is defeated by carryover [becker2019tracking][bt-core-spec]. Be aware the physical-layer fingerprint is a residual exposure that content hygiene cannot close [givehchian2022physical].
- **Integrator:** During acceptance testing, run this passive sweep and reject builds that ship a public/static address, a never-rotating RPA, or identity-bearing AdvData. Verify any vendor "privacy mode" is enabled in the shipped configuration, not merely available (BSAM-DI-06).
- **Operator:** Treat BLE advertising as broadcast-to-the-world. For trackable assets, minimise continuous advertising where the use case allows (intermittent advertising materially reduces carryover-tracking feasibility [becker2019tracking]), and account for the residual physical-layer-fingerprint risk in the threat model for high-sensitivity deployments [givehchian2022physical].

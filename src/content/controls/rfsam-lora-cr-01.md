title: Assess LoRaWAN join and session-key management
protocol: LORA
layer: CR
criticality: high
applicability:
  - LoRaWAN
deferred: false
objective: >-
  Determine whether a LoRaWAN deployment's join procedure and key management are
  sound, that the root AppKey is a per-device random value (not default, shared
  or guessable), that DevNonce is fresh per join, and that session keys are not
  static and reused, by analysing captured join and data frames against the
  network's stated LoRaWAN version and activation mode.
intro: >-
  LoRaWAN's entire confidentiality and integrity model hangs off the root key:
  the AppKey (1.0.x) or NwkKey+AppKey (1.1) from which every session key is
  derived. There is no feasible brute force of a strong random AES-128 key, the
  exposure is in how keys and nonces are managed. This control checks the join
  and session-key chain for default/shared keys, DevNonce reuse, and static ABP
  session keys, the recurring real-world failures that collapse the crypto.
prerequisites:
  hardware:
    - 'An SDR covering the regional sub-GHz band (RTL-SDR V4 for one channel, or HackRF One / USRP B210 / bladeRF 2.0 micro for wider capture), or a multi-channel LoRaWAN gateway (RAK WisGate Connect) if you have gateway access'
    - 'A host to run the offline key/MIC analysis (no transmit hardware needed, this control is analysis over an existing capture)'
  software:
    - 'A CSS demodulator that frames LoRaWAN and exports LoRaTap PCAP (gr-lora_sdr, LoRAttack) plus Wireshark, then an offline LoRaWAN crypto toolkit: Loracrack (weak/shared AppKey → session-key derivation) and/or LAF (MIC recompute/validate, key-candidate testing)'
  signal:
    freq: '863 to 870 MHz (EU868) / 902 to 928 MHz (US915) / regional: AS923, EU433, AU915, CN470, IN865, KR920'
    bandwidth: '125 / 250 / 500 kHz per LoRaWAN channel'
    modulation: 'CSS (Chirp Spread Spectrum), SF7 to SF12'
  skill: advanced
attacks:
  - name: Default / shared / hardcoded AppKey recovery
    refs:
      - ioactive2020lorawan
      - laf
    impact: >-
      Recovering or guessing the root AppKey lets an attacker derive both session
      keys (NwkSKey, AppSKey) for every session, decrypt all application traffic,
      and forge frames with valid MICs, a full break of the device's crypto.
    preconditions: >-
      The device uses a default, shared, vendor-wide or otherwise guessable
      AppKey, or one extractable from firmware / public source; plus a captured
      OTAA join (and following data frames). The strong-random-key case is not
      brute-forceable.
    summary: >-
      LoRaWAN's confidentiality and integrity derive entirely from the root key;
      IOActive documented hardcoded, default and weak AppKeys in real deployments
      and firmware, and the LAF toolkit tests AppKey candidates against captured
      frames via the MIC.
  - name: DevNonce reuse / random-nonce join replay (1.0.x)
    refs:
      - hessel2022survey
      - loraalliance2020joinsync
      - na2017replay
    impact: >-
      A repeated DevNonce on a 1.0.x device enables replay of captured
      JoinRequests, forcing rejoin/desynchronisation or denial of service, and
      indicates a join-security model that does not reject stale nonces.
    preconditions: >-
      A LoRaWAN 1.0.0 to 1.0.3 device whose DevNonce is a random value (birthday
      collision over device lifetime) or reused after reboot/poor RNG; the join
      is cleartext, so the DevNonce sequence is observable passively.
    summary: >-
      In 1.0.x DevNonce is a random value the network must remember-and-reject;
      reuse (collision, reboot, weak RNG) allows JoinRequest replay. 1.0.4/1.1
      close this by making DevNonce a monotonic counter that is never reused.
  - name: Static ABP session keys / frame-counter reset
    refs:
      - hessel2022survey
      - tarlogic2020lorawan
    impact: >-
      ABP devices carry static NwkSKey/AppSKey that never rotate; a frame-counter
      reset on reboot repeats the keystream (two-time pad on the AES-CTR-style
      payload) and re-opens replay, both reachable without ever recovering the key.
    preconditions: >-
      An ABP-activated device (static session keys + DevAddr burned in) whose
      frame counter resets on power-cycle, captured passively.
    summary: >-
      ABP trades key rotation for simplicity: static session keys plus a
      resettable frame counter give keystream reuse and replay, the
      session-key-management failure OTAA is designed to avoid.

    Pure offline analysis: prerequisites state "no transmit hardware needed" and the
    capture is delegated to the LL-layer control. Steps 3 and 4 are tshark and a
    Python key test over an existing PCAP - the most automatable work in the corpus.
    Not marked auto for two honest reasons: the body still carries unresolved
    [FILL: ...] placeholders, and step 5 needs someone to power-cycle an ABP device
    to see whether its counters reset. Resolve the placeholders and move step 5 out,
    and this becomes the corpus's first genuine auto.

## Mechanism

LoRaWAN's confidentiality and integrity derive entirely from a root key, so this layer is about key and nonce *management*, not cipher strength. In 1.0.x the device and back end share an AppKey; in 1.1 the root is split into NwkKey and AppKey. From the root, the two session keys are derived: the `AppSKey` encrypts the `FRMPayload` (AES-128), and the `NwkSKey` keys the 4-byte MIC (AES-128-CMAC) [loraalliance2020l2][hessel2022survey]. There is no feasible brute force of a strong random AES-128 root key; the real-world exposure is that the key is often not strong, not unique, or not secret, and that the join nonce and session keys are mismanaged [hessel2022survey].

**Default / shared / hardcoded AppKey.** IOActive's audit of real LoRaWAN deployments found root keys that were hardcoded in firmware, shared fleet-wide, set to vendor defaults, or otherwise easy to source from public repositories or weak enough to guess [ioactive2020lorawan]. Because every session key descends from that root, recovering it once decrypts all traffic for the device's lifetime and lets an attacker forge frames with valid MICs, a complete crypto break [ioactive2020lorawan][hessel2022survey]. This is exactly what a candidate-key test demonstrates: given a guessed/leaked AppKey and a captured join, derive the session keys and confirm by recomputing the captured MIC [loracrack][laf]. It is *not* a brute force of a strong key [loracrack].

**DevNonce reuse / join replay (1.0.x).** The OTAA `JoinRequest` carries `JoinEUI`/`AppEUI`, `DevEUI` and a `DevNonce` in the clear, protected only by a MIC, the key is never transmitted, but the DevNonce sequence is fully observable passively [loraalliance2020l2]. In LoRaWAN 1.0.0 to 1.0.3 the DevNonce is a *random* value, and the network must remember and reject previously-seen values; a repeat lets a captured JoinRequest be replayed [na2017replay][loraalliance2020joinsync]. Reuse is not hypothetical: the random nonce is subject to the birthday paradox over a multi-year lifetime, and constrained devices reuse nonces after reboots, counter resets, or poor RNG seeding [hessel2022survey]. LoRaWAN 1.0.4 and 1.1 redefine DevNonce as a monotonic counter that SHALL never be reused for a given JoinEUI, closing this window, at the cost of the join-synchronisation problems the LoRa Alliance documents for mixed fleets [loraalliance2020joinsync][loraalliance2020l2].

**Static ABP session keys / frame-counter reset.** ABP (Activation By Personalisation) burns static `NwkSKey`/`AppSKey`/`DevAddr` into the device with no per-join rotation. If the frame counter resets on power-cycle, the AES-CTR-style payload encryption repeats keystream (a two-time pad recoverable by XOR) and stale frames become replayable, both reachable without ever recovering the key [hessel2022survey][tarlogic2020lorawan]. OTAA exists precisely to avoid this by deriving fresh session keys at each join.

The IOActive findings (default/hardcoded/weak AppKeys) are reported across audited deployments and firmware, not a single named CVE; treat them as a representative pattern and check the specific device/stack before asserting a given deployment is affected. Loracrack and LAF are PoC/audit tooling (Loracrack last pushed 2022-06, LAF 2023-05); re-confirm they build against your capture format and LoRaWAN version before relying on them.

## Procedure

> Authorised testing only. Capturing and analysing another network's traffic, and
> testing any candidate key against it, requires explicit written permission and
> must be lawful in your jurisdiction. Do not transmit at this layer; this control
> is offline analysis over a capture you are authorised to hold. Test AppKey
> candidates only against your own / in-scope devices.

1. **Capture the join and following data frames** for the target device, per RFSAM-RES-07 and RFSAM-LORA-LL-01, de-chirp the CSS waveform and export a LoRaTap PCAP that contains at least one OTAA `JoinRequest`/`JoinAccept` pair and subsequent uplinks for the same `DevAddr`. Confirm in Wireshark:
   ```text
   lorawan.mtype == 0     # Join Request: JoinEUI/AppEUI, DevEUI, DevNonce (cleartext)
   lorawan.mtype == 1     # Join Accept (encrypted)
   ```
   Expected: the join identifiers readable in the clear; the `FRMPayload` of data frames shown as AES-128 ciphertext.

2. **Establish the LoRaWAN version and activation mode** (from the IG step / device profile). The checks below differ for 1.0.x vs 1.0.4/1.1, and for OTAA vs ABP. Record which applies.

3. **Audit DevNonce freshness (OTAA, 1.0.x).** Group `JoinRequest`s by `DevEUI` and extract the `DevNonce` sequence. Export the join frames and tabulate:
   ```bash
   # tshark over the LoRaTap PCAP: one row per JoinRequest
   tshark -r joins.pcap -Y "lorawan.mtype == 0" \
     -T fields -e lorawan.dev_eui -e lorawan.dev_nonce | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
   ```
   Expected: a count per `(DevEUI, DevNonce)`. Any count > 1 is a reused DevNonce → 1.0.x join-replay exposure [loraalliance2020joinsync]. A small or clustered nonce space (few distinct values, or values biased low) indicates weak RNG even without an exact repeat [hessel2022survey].

4. **Test for a weak / shared / default AppKey (OTAA).** Assemble candidate keys: vendor defaults, all-zero / sample keys from datasheets or SDKs, keys extracted from firmware, and any fleet-wide value you suspect is reused. Feed the captured join + a data frame and each candidate to the derivation-and-MIC check:
   ```bash
   # Loracrack: derive session keys from a candidate AppKey and validate via the MIC
   python loracrack.py --pcap capture.pcap --appkey <CANDIDATE_APPKEY>
   ```
   Expected: for the *correct* key, the tool derives `NwkSKey`/`AppSKey` and the recomputed MIC matches the captured frame's MIC, confirming the key and that the session is now decryptable [loracrack]. For a wrong key the MIC mismatches. Equivalently, use LAF to recompute and validate the MIC against a key candidate [laf]. A match is a finding: the root key is not secret.

   > A MIC match means you have recovered the session keys for that capture. Decrypt only traffic you are authorised to analyse; do not act on recovered keys beyond the agreed scope.

5. **Audit ABP session-key hygiene (ABP).** For ABP devices, confirm whether the frame counter (`FCnt`) ever resets, capture across a device reboot/power-cycle in your test rig and check for a counter that returns to a low value while the `DevAddr` and (static) keys are unchanged:
   ```text
   lorawan.dev_addr == <TARGET_DEVADDR>     # then read the FCnt column over time
   ```
   Expected: a healthy device's `FCnt` increases monotonically. A reset (a high value followed by a low one) under static keys is the keystream-reuse / replay finding [hessel2022survey][tarlogic2020lorawan].

6. **Record the result per device:** version + activation mode; DevNonce behaviour (fresh / reused / weak-RNG); AppKey result (strong-random vs a candidate that produced a MIC match); ABP `FCnt` reset (y/n). Each positive is a key-management failure that collapses some or all of the crypto chain.

## Field case

Reported measurement (carried over from the paired link-layer control). The same authorised US915 capture used to profile this network at the link layer (RFSAM-LORA-LL-01), 51,304 LoRaWAN frames, of which 45,815 (89.3%) were JoinRequests, is the input for the CR-layer key analysis: because the capture was so heavily dominated by JoinRequests, each device's DevNonce sequence was directly observable in the clear, which is the prerequisite for spotting reuse [loraalliance2020joinsync]. The application payloads stayed AES-128 protected throughout, confidentiality held against the *capture*; the question this control asks is whether it holds against the *key management*. This frame/JoinRequest count is the author's reported field figure, reproduced verbatim from the paired RFSAM-LORA-LL-01 control; it has not been independently re-measured here.

Illustrative walkthrough, substitute the values you capture. To reproduce against your own authorised test network: stand up a couple of OTAA devices and one ABP device on a ChirpStack/RAK gateway, deliberately provision one OTAA device with a default/sample AppKey (so the key-candidate test in step 4 succeeds), and one 1.0.x device that re-joins on reboot (so step 3 shows a DevNonce repeat). Then run steps 3 to 5 and tabulate:

```text
# per-device key-management findings from an authorised test capture
DevEUI / DevAddr        version  activation  DevNonce        AppKey test       ABP FCnt reset
[FILL: id]              1.0.3    OTAA        [FILL: repeated?] MIC match (2b11ff0d) n/a
[FILL: id]              1.1      OTAA        monotonic        [FILL: no match]  n/a
[FILL: id]              1.0.3    ABP         n/a              n/a               [FILL: y/n]
```

Reproducible public worked example (no live capture) for the step-4 cell. Rather than depend on a live measurement, the candidate-key/MIC test for the weak OTAA row above is grounded in a documented public test vector shipped with the `lora-packet` library [lorapacket]. For the data uplink frame `40F17DBE4900020001954378762B11FF0D`, feeding the candidate NwkSKey `44024241ed4ce9a68c6a8bc055233fd3` recomputes the MIC as `2b11ff0d`, which equals the frame's trailing MIC bytes, `verifyMIC` returns true (`MIC check=OK`), and feeding the AppSKey `ec925802ae430ca77fd3dd73cb2cc588` decrypts the `FRMPayload` to the ASCII plaintext `test`. The same library's vectors also confirm the join side: for the JoinRequest `0039363463336913AA05693574323831330489C65B1304`, the candidate AppKey `98929b92c49edba9676d646d3b612456` recomputes the JoinRequest MIC as `c65b1304`, again matching the frame. These values are self-consistent and reproducible entirely offline (`__tests__/mic_test.ts`, `__tests__/decrypt_test.ts`, and the README CLI decoder walkthrough), so the "candidate key → MIC match → decryptable payload" chain of step 4 can be demonstrated end-to-end without any live RF capture [lorapacket].

The expected shape: the deliberately weak OTAA device yields a MIC match under the default key (its session keys are recoverable and traffic decryptable, exactly as the `lora-packet` vector above shows), the 1.0.x re-joining device shows a repeated DevNonce (join-replay exposure), and the ABP device's counter resets across reboot (keystream-reuse/replay exposure), while a correctly provisioned 1.1 OTAA device passes all three. The remaining `[FILL: …]` cells above are placeholders for the values you capture in your own authorised analysis, they are not measured findings.

## Remediation

**Developer (device / stack).** Provision a unique, cryptographically random AppKey (1.0.x) or NwkKey+AppKey (1.1) per device; never ship a default, sample, all-zero, fleet-wide or firmware-hardcoded root key, since recovering it once breaks every session for the device's life [ioactive2020lorawan][hessel2022survey]. Generate DevNonce correctly: on 1.0.4/1.1 use the mandated monotonic counter that is never reused for a JoinEUI and persists across reboots; on legacy 1.0.x with a random DevNonce, ensure adequate RNG entropy and persistence so nonces do not repeat after a reset [loraalliance2020l2][loraalliance2020joinsync]. Prefer OTAA over ABP so session keys are derived fresh at each join rather than burned in static.

**Integrator (network / join server).** Enforce strict server-side DevNonce tracking: remember and reject previously-seen DevNonce values (1.0.x) or enforce monotonicity (1.0.4/1.1), so a replayed JoinRequest is denied [na2017replay][loraalliance2020joinsync]. For ABP deployments, enforce frame-counter validation that survives device reboots, reject a counter that resets rather than accepting it, to neutralise the keystream-reuse and replay paths [hessel2022survey][tarlogic2020lorawan]. Where feasible, migrate to 1.1's split keys and Join Server, and ensure no 1.0.x elements remain in a network claimed to be 1.1, since backward compatibility reopens the older weaknesses [tarlogic2020lorawan].

**Operator (deployment).** Treat the root key as the crown jewel: rotate keys where the lifecycle allows, audit that every deployed device carries a unique key (not a shared batch value), and protect the network/join server credentials so the keys cannot be read from an exposed back end [ioactive2020lorawan]. Periodically run this passive join/session-key audit against your own network as a monitoring control, a recurring DevNonce, a successful default-key derivation, or a resetting ABP counter is a provisioning failure to fix, not merely an attacker's opportunity.

title: Demodulate and frame a Sub-GHz burst
protocol: SUBG
layer: PHY
criticality: low
applicability:
  - OOK/ASK
  - 2-FSK
  - GFSK
  - Manchester
  - PWM
  - PPM
deferred: false
objective: >-
  Verify whether a captured Sub-GHz burst can be demodulated to a clean
  bitstream and framed into symbols, recovering the modulation, bit rate and
  line coding well enough to deliver bits to the link layer, without any key
  material.
intro: >-
  Most ISM-band devices transmit narrowband OOK/ASK or (G)FSK with no spreading
  or scrambling, so a captured burst demodulates to bits with SDR tooling plus a
  CC1101-class radio. This control turns the waveform into framed symbols, the
  prerequisite that every downstream replay, forgery or analysis depends on.
prerequisites:
  hardware:
    - 'A receive-capable SDR for I/Q capture: RTL-SDR Blog V4 (sub-GHz, RX only) or HackRF One (wideband, half-duplex)'
    - 'Optionally a CC1101/CC1111-class transceiver for hardware demodulation: YARD Stick One, or the CatSniffer SX1262 for (G)FSK'
  software:
    - 'Universal Radio Hacker (demodulate + auto-detect modulation/bit rate)'
    - 'rtl_433 (pulse demodulator and analyzer, -A / -X flex)'
    - 'rfcat (drive a YARD Stick One at recovered layer-1 settings)'
  signal:
    freq: '315 / 433.92 / 868 / 915 MHz regional ISM (sub-1.7 GHz)'
    bandwidth: 'Narrowband, a few kHz to low tens of kHz; sample rate must cover the burst bandwidth'
    modulation: 'OOK/ASK or (G)FSK; line coding usually PWM, PPM, Manchester or raw NRZ at a few hundred to a few thousand baud'
  skill: intermediate

      Recovers the device's bitstream from a passive capture with no key, exposing
      the frame contents and enabling the downstream capture/replay and forgery steps.
    preconditions: >-
      A clean I/Q recording centred on the carrier; the signal is unspread,
      unscrambled OOK/ASK or (G)FSK, as nearly all sub-GHz ISM devices are.
    summary: >-
      Because the waveform carries the bits in the clear, demodulating and framing
      it is a tooling exercise, not a cryptographic one, the PHY layer offers no
      barrier on its own.

    impact: >-
      Estimates modulation, bit length/rate and line coding directly from the I/Q,
      letting an auditor skip the physical layer and work at the protocol level.
    preconditions: A captured signal loaded into URH; enough samples to estimate the bit length.
    summary: >-
      URH and its auto-detection routine infer the demodulation parameters from the
      recording, lowering the skill needed to frame an unknown burst.

## Mechanism

Sub-GHz ISM devices are built for cost, not stealth: nearly all of them transmit narrowband **OOK/ASK** (the carrier blinks the bits on and off) or **(G)FSK** (the carrier shifts between two tones), with no spread-spectrum and no scrambling [rtl433primer]. That makes the physical layer a pure signal-processing problem, there is no key, no de-spreading, and no channel hopping to defeat before the bits appear. Demodulation recovers the symbol stream; framing then resolves the **line coding**, typically PWM, PPM, Manchester or raw NRZ at a few hundred to a few thousand baud, into bits [rtl433primer].

Two demodulation paths exist, and they are equivalent at this layer. A **software path** loads an I/Q recording from an SDR and slices it: rtl_433 runs a pulse demodulator and, with `-A`, reports the measured pulse width, gap width and period so you can read the coding by eye, while `-X` lets you write a flex decoder for an unrecognised device [rtl433primer]. A **hardware path** programs a CC1101/CC1111-class transceiver (driven by rfcat) to the recovered carrier, modulation and baud, letting the radio chip itself do the demodulation, the hybrid SDR-plus-dedicated-radio workflow Ossmann set out as "rapid radio reversing" [ossmann2015rrr]. Universal Radio Hacker sits in the middle: it visualises the burst, **auto-detects the modulation and bit length** directly from the I/Q, and extracts the bitstream [pohl2018urh][urhrepo]. That auto-detection, estimating all the demodulation parameters from the recording so an analyst can skip the physical layer, is the subject of Pohl and Noack's follow-on work [pohl2019autopre].

The security relevance at PHY is exactly this absence of a barrier. Because the bits travel in the clear, framing the burst is a tooling exercise rather than a cryptographic one [ossmann2015rrr][rtl433primer]; the recovered bitstream is what every downstream control, capture/replay, rolling-vs-fixed determination, forgery, consumes. This control verifies only that the bits can be recovered cleanly; it does not yet replay or forge them.

The applicability list and the bit-rate range ("a few hundred to a few thousand baud") are the representative envelope for the band, the modulation and line-coding families and the few-hundred-to-few-thousand-baud range are the general behaviour documented for ISM-band devices [rtl433primer], not a guarantee for any one target, which must be measured per device.

## Procedure

All steps below are passive receive-and-demodulate. They involve no transmission and so need no special authorisation, but any later replay/forgery step does, perform those only on equipment you own or are explicitly authorised to test.

1. **Capture the burst as I/Q**, centred on the carrier found at the Spectrum step, at a sample rate that comfortably covers the burst bandwidth. With an RTL-SDR or HackRF:
   ```bash
   rtl_sdr -f 433920000 -s 1024000 -g 40 capture.iq
   ```
   Trigger the device a few times during the capture. A non-empty file with visible energy when you trigger the device confirms a usable recording; silence means re-check the frequency/gain.

2. **Read the modulation and timing with rtl_433's analyzer.** Point it at the band and enable the analyzer/verbose pulse output:
   ```bash
   rtl_433 -f 433.92M -A
   ```
   Expected: for a recognised device, a JSON line naming it; for an unknown one, the analyzer prints measured **pulse width, gap width and pulse period** and a guess at the coding (OOK_PWM / OOK_PPM / OOK_MC / FSK). Read those numbers, they are the bit rate and line coding [rtl433primer].

3. **Demodulate and frame in Universal Radio Hacker** when rtl_433 has no decoder. Load the recording and let URH auto-detect:
   ```bash
   urh                       # GUI: Interpretation tab → "Autodetect parameters"
   ```
   Expected: URH labels the **modulation** (ASK/FSK), estimates the **bit length / samples-per-symbol**, and renders the burst as a bit string. Set the decoding (Manchester / PWM / NRZ) until the preamble and a stable structure appear [pohl2018urh][pohl2019autopre].

4. **Confirm the framing is correct**, not just plausible. The same physical press, captured twice, must demodulate to the same bits (for a fixed-code device) or differ only in the expected counter field (rolling). A demod whose bit count drifts between identical presses means the bit length or coding is still wrong, return to step 3.

5. **(Optional) Validate against a hardware demodulator.** Program a YARD Stick One to the recovered settings and receive the same burst, cross-checking the bitstream:
   ```python
   # rfcat (interactive)
   d.setFreq(433920000)
   d.setMdmModulation(MOD_ASK_OOK)
   d.setMdmDRate(2400)            # baud recovered above
   print(d.RFrecv())
   ```
   Matching bits from an independent CC1111 radio confirm the PHY parameters are right and not an SDR artefact.

## Field case

Passive reception run on 2026-09-18 at Electronic Cats, Aguascalientes, from a window facing the street. Receiver: an RTL-SDR (R820T tuner) with its stock whip antenna on a magnetic base, placed on the metal window frame. Receive only: nothing was transmitted and no vehicle was interacted with.

rtl_433 25.12 was left hopping between the two bands where tyre-pressure sensors (TPMS) are expected, 10 s on each, at its default 250 kHz sample rate:

```bash
rtl_433 -f 315M -f 433.92M -H 10 -F json -M time:iso
```

This is the recognised-device route of step 2: rtl_433 already has a decoder for these sensors, so it names the device instead of printing raw pulse timings.

Result, from 10:16:48 to 10:42:04 (about 25 minutes):

- 8 frames were decoded, from 5 different sensors: 3 reporting as Toyota TPMS and 2 as Renault TPMS.
- Every frame passed the decoder's integrity check (`"mic" : "CRC"`).
- Each of the three Toyota sensors was received as two frames within the same second, carrying the same sensor ID, pressure and temperature and differing only in the status field (130, then 131). This is the repeat check of step 4 on live traffic: two transmissions from the same sensor demodulate to the same identifier and readings.
- The readings are plausible for tyres in use: 34.5 to 34.75 PSI on the Toyota sensors, 223.5 to 225 kPa on the Renault sensors, 29 to 35 C.

| Time | Decoder | Sensor ID | Pressure | Temperature | Frames |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 10:16:48 | Toyota TPMS | `d784124a` | 34.75 PSI | 30 C | 2 (status 130, 131) |
| 10:31:04 | Renault TPMS | `1cd96e` | 225 kPa | 35 C | 1 |
| 10:31:06 | Renault TPMS | `1cd963` | 223.5 kPa | 34 C | 1 |
| 10:42:04 | Toyota TPMS | `d7874db3` | 34.5 PSI | 34 C | 2 (status 130, 131) |
| 10:42:04 | Toyota TPMS | `d7840ef3` | 34.5 PSI | 29 C | 2 (status 130, 131) |

PHY parameters. These come from the decoders that produced the frames, not from a measurement of our own: both sensors are FSK with a 52 us symbol (12 to 13 samples at 250 kHz); the Toyota sensor uses differential Manchester coding and the Renault sensor Manchester coding, each closed by a CRC-8 [rtl433tpmstoyota][rtl433tpmsrenault]. A frame that passes that CRC means the modulation, symbol rate and line coding were all right for that burst.

What this session does not show. The manual route of steps 1 and 3 (record I/Q, then demodulate and frame in URH) was not completed for these sensors: no I/Q recording of a TPMS burst was demodulated to a bitstream matching the decoded frames. The rtl_433 output kept from this session also does not say which of the two bands each frame arrived on, so the band per sensor is not recorded.

## Remediation

Demodulation is auditor-side, there is no "fix" for the ability to recover bits from a clear waveform. The defensive value of this control is what the clean bitstream proves: that **the PHY layer authenticates nothing**. Layered guidance for the parties who can act on it:

- **Developer (device firmware/silicon).** Do not treat a stable, recoverable ID broadcast in the clear as a security property, identification is not authentication. If confidentiality or integrity matters, add it above the PHY (an authenticated/encrypted payload, a true rolling code with an adequate window, a freshness/nonce field), because the waveform itself will always demodulate [ossmann2015rrr][rtl433primer]. Avoid trivially short keyspaces (e.g. 8 to 12 DIP-switch bits) that a recovered frame format makes brute-forceable.
- **Integrator (product builder).** Choose modules whose security does not rest on obscurity of the modulation or line coding; assume an auditor (and an attacker) can frame the burst with rtl_433 or URH within minutes [pohl2018urh]. Where a clear-text fixed code is unavoidable for a function, ensure that function is not safety- or access-critical, or gate it behind a second, authenticated channel.
- **Operator (deployment).** Recognise that a captured remote, sensor or contact-closure signal can be reproduced from a passive recording; for access-control or safety roles, prefer devices documented to use authenticated rolling codes, and monitor for the replay/jamming the demodulated frame enables downstream. Frame any vendor protocol list as representative, check current advisories and rtl_433's supported-device set, which change often [rtl433repo].

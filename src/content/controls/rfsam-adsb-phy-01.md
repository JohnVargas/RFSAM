title: Capture and decode ADS-B messages
protocol: ADSB
layer: PHY
criticality: info
applicability:
  - ADS-B
  - 1090ES
  - 978 UAT
deferred: false
objective: >-
  Determine whether the target's ADS-B transmissions can be received and decoded
  from the air with a low-cost SDR, recovering the 24-bit ICAO address, callsign,
  CPR-encoded position and velocity from DF17/DF18 Extended Squitter frames, which
  establishes the capture baseline every downstream plausibility and spoofing
  assessment depends on.
intro: >-
  ADS-B is a one-way, unencrypted, unauthenticated broadcast: there is nothing to
  decrypt, only a public waveform to receive and decode. This PHY control verifies
  the capture baseline, demodulating the 1 Mbps pulse-position waveform and reading
  out the 112-bit Extended Squitter, that the spectrum, attack and air-picture
  controls all build on. It is observational; forging frames is assessed separately
  at the Attack layer.
prerequisites:
  hardware:
    - 'A receive-only SDR: RTL-SDR Blog V4 is the canonical cheap 1090/978 MHz receiver. A 1090 MHz quarter-wave (~6.9 cm) antenna; for weak/distant traffic a 1090 MHz band-pass filter and an LNA.'
  software:
    - 'A 1090ES decoder (dump1090-fa, readsb, or gr-air-modes); for the US 978 MHz link, dump978; pyModeS to decode/inspect individual frames.'
  signal:
    freq: '1090 MHz (Mode S Extended Squitter, worldwide); additionally 978 MHz (UAT, US lower-altitude general aviation)'
    bandwidth: '~2 MHz around the carrier (a single bursty channel; no hopping)'
    modulation: 'Pulse-position modulation (PPM) at 1 Mbps; an Extended Squitter is a 112-bit frame (8 µs preamble + 112 µs data). 978 UAT uses a different ~1.04 Mbps waveform with a 272-bit message.'
  skill: beginner
attacks:
  - name: Passive eavesdropping of ADS-B
    refs:
      - costin2012ghost
      - strohmeier2013survey
    impact: >-
      Full recovery of every transmitting aircraft's identity (ICAO address,
      callsign), position and velocity in the clear, supports tracking, targeting
      and reconnaissance, and is the prerequisite observation step for any active
      spoofing.
    preconditions: A receive-capable SDR within radio range of the transmitter; no keys, no association.
    summary: >-
      Because ADS-B is an unencrypted broadcast, any receiver decodes the full
      message contents passively. The eavesdropping baseline this control verifies.
  - name: Forged-frame injection / ghost aircraft (capability enabled by missing authentication)
    refs:
      - costin2012ghost
      - schafer2013experimental
      - strohmeier2017perception
    impact: >-
      Injection of non-existent ('ghost') aircraft, modification of an existing
      track, or flooding of the air picture, every receiver in range accepts a
      well-formed 1090ES frame as a genuine aircraft.
    preconditions: >-
      A TX-capable SDR and the ability to emit a well-formed higher-power 1090ES
      frame. Out of scope for this PHY capture control; assessed at the Attack layer
      and only over a conducted/shielded path on authorised research equipment.
    summary: >-
      The same missing link-layer authentication that makes capture trivial also
      makes forged frames indistinguishable from real ones; documented experimentally
      but actively performed only under the Attack-layer control.

    All six steps receive: dump1090-fa and dump978 demodulate, readsb serves the
    feed, pyModeS verifies individual frames offline. Nothing transmits, which is
    what makes this control safe on a T1 safety-of-life band. Its field case is
    the most automatable thing in the corpus - `modes decode <hex>` over published
    test vectors, deterministic and requiring no radio at all - but the control as
    a whole still needs someone to mount and aim a 1090 MHz antenna first.

## Mechanism

ADS-B 'out' is a periodic, one-way broadcast in which an aircraft reports its own
state, identity, position, velocity, with no interrogation, no association, no
encryption and no authentication [costin2012ghost][strohmeier2013survey]. Worldwide
it rides the 1090 MHz Mode S Extended Squitter (1090ES); in the US, lower-altitude
general aviation additionally uses a separate 978 MHz UAT link [strohmeier2017perception].
On 1090 MHz the signal is pulse-position modulation at 1 Mbps, and an Extended
Squitter is a fixed 112-bit frame (an 8 µs preamble followed by 112 µs of data
bits) [sun2021riddle]. There is no frequency hopping and no channelisation: every
aircraft squitters on the same carrier, so a single ~2 MHz receiver sees the whole
picture, and the only contention is overlapping bursts. On 1090 MHz the bit period
is 1 µs (a pulse in the first half of the period is a `1`, in the second half a `0`),
giving the 1 Mbps rate; the 978 MHz UAT link instead uses CPFSK at 1.041667 Mbps with
a 272-bit long message [sun2021riddle].

The 112-bit frame begins with a 5-bit downlink format. ADS-B uses **DF17** for
transponder-equipped aircraft and **DF18** for non-transponder / TIS-B transmitters;
it then carries the 24-bit ICAO aircraft address and a 5-bit type code that selects
the payload, aircraft identification (the 8-character callsign), airborne or surface
position (latitude/longitude in Compact Position Reporting, CPR, encoding), or
velocity [sun2021riddle]. A 24-bit parity field lets a receiver validate the frame.
Crucially, **none of the identifiers is authenticated**: the ICAO address, callsign
and CPR position are broadcast in the clear with no signature and no integrity over
the source, so a receiver cannot tell a genuine aircraft from a forged one
[costin2012ghost][strohmeier2013survey].

This control verifies only the **receive-and-decode** baseline, the passive
eavesdropping that the literature established is trivially feasible with a cheap SDR
[costin2012ghost]. That same absent authentication is what makes the active attack
families possible: experimental work has demonstrated message injection ('ghost
aircraft'), track modification, jamming and flooding against ADS-B receivers
[schafer2013experimental][strohmeier2017perception]. Those are **legally sensitive
transmit operations** on protected aviation safety spectrum and are assessed under
the Attack-layer control, not here; this PHY control stays receive-only.

## Procedure

> Receive-only throughout. Capturing and decoding ADS-B is passive and generally
> lawful, but transmitting on 1090/978 MHz is not, do not transmit at any step here.

1. Confirm the band is alive before committing a decoder. Tune an SDR to 1090 MHz in
   a waterfall viewer and watch for the short, bursty Extended-Squitter pulses (ADS-B
   sits above the noise floor, so they are visibly bursty):
   ```bash
   gqrx
   # set the device to your RTL-SDR, tune 1090.000 MHz, sample rate ~2.4 MSPS
   ```
   Expected: intermittent narrow pulses popping up at the carrier as aircraft
   squitter. If you see nothing, check the antenna/filter chain (a 1090 MHz band-pass
   filter + LNA dramatically lifts weak traffic) before blaming the decoder.

2. Decode the 1090ES link with a primary decoder. dump1090-fa demodulates the PPM
   bursts, validates the parity and decodes DF17/DF18, with an interactive table:
   ```bash
   dump1090-fa --device-type rtlsdr --gain -10 --interactive
   ```
   Expected: a live table of aircraft keyed by ICAO hex address, with callsign,
   altitude, position (once a CPR even/odd pair is collected) and speed. A handful of
   rows means a few local aircraft; a busy sky fills the table. `--gain -10` selects
   the tuner's automatic gain.

3. Serve the decoded feed for downstream tooling. For a permanent or busy receiver,
   run readsb and emit network output (Beast/raw/JSON) instead of (or as well as) the
   interactive view:
   ```bash
   readsb --device-type rtlsdr --net --write-json /run/readsb
   ```
   Expected: readsb starts, tracks many aircraft at once, and serves a JSON
   `aircraft.json` (consumed by a map such as tar1090) plus Beast/raw ports, the
   handoff point to the Application-layer air-picture and plausibility controls.

4. (US only) Add the 978 MHz UAT link. The 1090 decoders do not cover UAT; tune a
   second SDR to 978 MHz and run dump978 alongside:
   ```bash
   dump978-fa --sdr driver=rtlsdr | readsb --net --net-only --uat-in-port 30978
   ```
   Expected: UAT downlink frames from lower-altitude general aviation, merged into the
   same aircraft picture.

5. Verify decode correctness on individual frames with pyModeS, the decode you can
   reason about by hand. Feed a hex frame to the CLI:
   ```bash
   modes decode 8D406B902015A678D4D220AA4BDA
   ```
   Expected: `df 17`, `icao 406B90`, `typecode 4` (identification), callsign
   `EZY85MH`, confirming the demodulated bits decode to a sensible identity. This is
   the per-frame ground truth behind the live table.

6. (Optional) Demodulate inside a flowgraph instead of a black-box decoder, when you
   want to see each DSP stage (preamble correlation, bit slicing):
   ```bash
   uhd_modes.py     # gr-air-modes receiver, or run its GNU Radio flowgraph
   ```
   Expected: the same DF17/DF18 decode, with the signal processing exposed for
   inspection or modification.

## Field case

A reproducible bench check using pyModeS's own published example frames (no air
capture or transmitter required), confirming the decode chain end to end. Decode a
matched CPR even/odd airborne-position pair plus an identification and a velocity
frame:

```bash
modes decode 8D40058B58C901375147EFD09357,8D40058B58C904A87F402D3B8C59,8D406B902015A678D4D220AA4BDA
```

The two `8D40058B…` frames are the even and odd halves of one CPR position for ICAO
`40058B`; together they resolve to a single latitude/longitude. The
`8D406B902015A678D4D220AA4BDA` frame is a DF17 type-code-4 identification for ICAO
`406B90`, decoding to callsign `EZY85MH`. A globally-referenced position decode for a
single even frame (no pair needed) confirms the CPR maths against a known receiver
location:

```bash
modes decode 8D40058B58C901375147EFD09357 --reference 49.0 6.0
```

These are the canonical pyModeS test vectors, so the expected outputs are stable: a
`40058B` position near the 49.0 N, 6.0 E reference and the `406B90` / `EZY85MH`
identity. This is the verifiable, reproducible core of the field case, the decode
chain confirmed against fixed, published frames, with no air capture or transmitter
required.

Illustrative walkthrough: in a real over-the-air session, you would log live frames 
from the local environment. In the authorized site capture conducted at Electronic Cats,
Aguascalientes, the measured over-the-air metrics recorded 59 distinct aircraft during 
the baseline session using a generic DAB+FM+DVB-T tuner (tracks.all: 59), with a frame 
parity pass fraction of 27.21% (16,066,399 out of 59,051,621 total frames) and a maximum 
range of 110,861 meters (110.86 km). Upon upgrading the receiver to a NESDR SMArt v5.2b8 
and adding an inline BT-200 LNA and 1090 MHz bandpass filter, the count of distinct aircraft
tracked rose to 86 (tracks.all: 86), the parity pass fraction was maintained at 27.54% 
(22,465,568 out of 81,576,560), and the maximum range increased to 160,484 meters (160.48 km),
representing a net range gain of 49,623 meters (49.62 km).

## Remediation

ADS-B's exposure is architectural, the link is plaintext and unauthenticated by
design [costin2012ghost][strohmeier2013survey], so "remediation" at this layer is
about not over-trusting the feed rather than securing the radio.

- **Developer (avionics / receiver firmware):** do not treat a decoded DF17/DF18
  frame as a trusted assertion of position or identity. Parity (the 24-bit CRC)
  proves the frame arrived intact, not that it came from the aircraft it names
  [sun2021riddle]. Where feasible, design toward the authenticated/integrity-protected
  ADS-B extensions and broadcast-authentication schemes proposed in the literature
  rather than the bare link [strohmeier2017perception].

- **Integrator (tracking / display / fusion systems):** never rely on ADS-B as a sole
  source of truth. Fuse it with independent sensors (primary/secondary radar,
  multilateration that times the same frame at several stations to fix an aircraft
  independently of what it claims) and run plausibility checks, impossible
  kinematics, positions inconsistent across receivers, ICAO addresses that should not
  be airborne [schafer2013experimental][strohmeier2017perception]. These detections
  are implemented at the Application layer; this PHY capture is their input.

- **Operator (researcher / SOC running a receiver):** keep receive-only, capturing
  and decoding ADS-B is passive and generally lawful, but transmitting on 1090/978 MHz
  is protected aviation safety spectrum and must never be radiated; any spoofing/
  injection assessment belongs to the Attack-layer control and is done only on
  authorised research equipment over a conducted (cabled) or shielded (Faraday)
  path, never on-air [strohmeier2017perception]. Log receiver statistics so an
  anomalous flood or a ghost track is visible against a known baseline.

title: 'Survey ARFCNs and confirm a captureable GSM carrier'
protocol: GSM
layer: SP
criticality: info
applicability:
  - GSM
deferred: false
objective: >-
  Establish which GSM carriers (ARFCNs) carry a live base station in the target
  band, record each carrier's strength, ARFCN and the receiver's clock error, and
  confirm at least one BCCH carrier falls inside the receiver's tuning envelope,
  the spectrum-layer prerequisite that scopes every later GSM capture control.
intro: >-
  A GSM carrier is a 200 kHz channel indexed by ARFCN, and a downlink BCCH carrier
  transmits continuously, so cells show as steady 200 kHz pickets in the waterfall.
  The reliable way to find them is to scan for the FCCH/SCH synchronisation bursts
  every BTS emits, which also yields each carrier's ARFCN, its power and the
  radio's clock offset (ppm). This control records that carrier inventory and
  confirms a captureable channel; it is an environmental baseline, not a device
  finding. Receiving broadcast information is passive, but anything that transmits
  on licensed cellular spectrum is for authorised testing only.
prerequisites:
  hardware:
    - 'A receive SDR covering the target band: RTL-SDR Blog V4 reaches GSM-850/900 and DCS-1800; PCS-1900 is at the top of its range, so prefer HackRF One / bladeRF 2.0 / USRP B210 there'
    - 'A clean antenna for the band in use (850/900 or 1800/1900 MHz)'
  software:
    - 'kalibrate-rtl (kal), sweeps a GSM band for live BTS carriers and reports ARFCN, power and ppm clock offset; use the matching HackRF/UHD kalibrate fork for those radios'
    - 'gqrx for the live spectrum/waterfall sanity check'
  signal:
    freq: 'GSM-850 / E-GSM-900 / DCS-1800 / PCS-1900, band depends on region (900/1800 most of the world, 850/1900 in the Americas); FDD, downlink/uplink spaced 45 MHz (900) / 95 MHz (1800)'
    bandwidth: '200 kHz per ARFCN carrier; each carrier is TDMA-divided into 8 timeslots'
    modulation: 'GMSK (0.3 BT Gaussian-filtered MSK) at 270.833 kbit/s; EDGE adds 8-PSK'
  skill: intermediate
attacks:
  - name: Passive IMSI / identity reconnaissance
    refs:
      - dabrowski2014
    impact: >-
      The carrier survey is the first step of GSM identity reconnaissance: once a
      BCCH carrier is found and demodulated, the cell pages handsets and, during
      attach / location update, exposes the IMSI in the clear, harvestable
      passively with no transmit, and the same broadcast an IMSI catcher mimics.
    preconditions: >-
      GSM authenticates the network to the phone one-way only (the cell never
      proves itself), and the BCCH / synchronisation channels are broadcast
      unprotected, so any receiver in range can locate the carrier and read the
      cell broadcast without a credential.
    summary: >-
      Dabrowski et al. show GSM's one-way authentication and cleartext IMSI
      exposure are what make passive identity collection and fake-base-station
      IMSI catchers practical; locating the live carrier is the entry step this
      control performs.

    kalibrate listens for the FCCH tone and gqrx is a view; nothing transmits. This
    is the most nearly-auto control of its phase: kal's output is parseable line by
    line (ARFCN, power, ppm) and needs no judgement, but receiving cellular spectrum
    is itself restricted in many jurisdictions, and by the corpus rule a control that
    does not transmit carries no tier. The mandate decides this one.

## Mechanism

A GSM deployment is a grid of cells, each served by a base station (BTS) that broadcasts on one or more 200 kHz carriers. The carrier is identified by its Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number (ARFCN): the carrier-to-frequency mapping, the 200 kHz channel spacing and the GMSK modulation at 270.833 kbit/s are defined in 3GPP TS 45.005 [ts45005]. Bands are regional, GSM-850 / E-GSM-900 in the Americas and the 900/1800 split elsewhere, and the ARFCN ranges and the FDD duplex offsets (45 MHz on the 900 band, 95 MHz on the 1800 band) follow the standard band plan [arfcn][ts45005]. Each carrier is divided by TDMA into 8 timeslots, so one 200 kHz channel carries up to 8 logical-channel streams [ts45002].

Because a downlink BCCH carrier transmits continuously, a live cell shows on a waterfall as a steady 200 kHz picket. But the reliable detector is the synchronisation structure rather than the eye: every BTS sends a Frequency Correction Channel (FCCH) burst and a Synchronisation Channel (SCH) burst in timeslot 0 of the BCCH carrier, on a fixed schedule within the 51-frame control multiframe [ts45002]. The FCCH burst is an all-zeros sequence that, after GMSK modulation, produces a pure tone at one quarter of the bit rate, (1625000/6)/4 ≈ 67.708 kHz above the carrier, so a receiver can find a GSM carrier, and measure its own oscillator error, by searching each candidate channel for that tone [ts45002][kalibrate]. This is exactly what `kalibrate` does: it sweeps a band, reports every ARFCN with a live BTS, its relative power, and the ppm clock offset to feed forward into the capture step [kalibrate].

The survey is also the entry point of GSM identity reconnaissance. GSM authenticates the network to the phone one-way only, the cell never proves itself, and the broadcast/synchronisation channels are unprotected, so any receiver in range can locate the carrier and read the cell's broadcast without a credential [dabrowski2014]. Once the BCCH carrier is demodulated, the cell pages handsets and, during attach / location update, exposes the IMSI in the clear; Dabrowski et al. show this cleartext identity exposure and one-way authentication are what make passive identity collection and fake-base-station IMSI catchers practical [dabrowski2014]. This control owns the spectrum-layer half, find the live carrier and confirm it is captureable; the GMSK demodulation and BCCH/CCCH/SDCCH decode are the work of the GSM capture (PHY/LL) controls, which run gr-gsm on the ARFCN found here [grgsm].

## Procedure

> Authorised testing only. Every step below is receive-only, you read what the
> network already broadcasts. Do not transmit on licensed cellular spectrum.

1. **Pick the band for your region and confirm your radio reaches it.** Decide which GSM band the operators use locally, GSM-850/900 and DCS-1800 are within an RTL-SDR Blog V4's range; PCS-1900 sits at the top of its tuning range, so prefer a HackRF / bladeRF / USRP there [ts45005][arfcn].

2. **Sweep the band for live carriers with kalibrate.** Point `kal` at the chosen band and let it lock onto FCCH/SCH bursts:
   ```bash
   kal -s GSM900 -g 40
   ```
   Expected output is one line per ARFCN that carries a live BTS, with its detected power, for example:
   ```text
   GSM-900:
     chan: 12 (937.4MHz - 8.146kHz)   power: 124847.16
     chan: 50 (945.0MHz + 1.215kHz)   power:  98213.44
   ```
   Each `chan:` line is a captureable carrier; the frequency offset is the per-channel clock error and the `power` ranks signal strength [kalibrate]. Record the ARFCNs and pick the strongest as your capture target.

3. **Measure the radio's clock offset (ppm) against the strongest carrier.** Re-run `kal` in single-channel mode on a strong ARFCN so it averages the FCCH tone into a stable ppm figure:
   ```bash
   kal -c 12
   ```
   Expected tail of the output is an average absolute error you carry forward to the capture tools, for example:
   ```text
   average		[+/-  0.022]
   overruns: 0
   not found: 0
   average absolute error: 1.243 ppm
   ```
   A small, stable ppm and zero overruns mean a clean lock; feed this ppm to gr-gsm so its tuning lands on the carrier centre [kalibrate].

4. **Eyeball the carrier to confirm the 200 kHz picket** with gqrx as a sanity check before committing a capture:
   ```bash
   gqrx
   ```
   In the GUI set the device to your SDR, tune to the ARFCN's centre frequency and watch the waterfall. A live downlink BCCH carrier shows as a steady, continuous ~200 kHz block; confirm its width and that it does not drift, then note its centre frequency [ts45005].

5. **Record the inventory.** For each carrier capture: band, ARFCN, downlink centre frequency, relative power, and the measured ppm offset. Mark which carriers fall inside your SDR's tuning envelope (RFSAM-RES-01), those are the sniffable targets that scope the GSM capture controls, which run gr-gsm on the chosen ARFCN to demodulate and decode the downlink [grgsm].

## Field case

> Authorised testing only, receive-only carrier survey on your own equipment.

The kalibrate-rtl README ships a documented example of exactly this workflow, which we use here as a public reference run rather than our own live capture; reproduce the same steps on your own authorised equipment and record your own ARFCN, power and ppm before treating any number as an engagement finding.

In the README's documented GSM-850 scan, `kal -s GSM850` surfaces several live ARFCNs and the strongest reading is `chan: 145 (872.6MHz - 7Hz) power: 33605.48` [kalibrate]. Re-running `kal -c 145` on that carrier averages the FCCH tone into a tight clock offset, `average -1Hz [-8, 7] (range 14, stddev 3.948722)` with `overruns: 0` and `not found: 0`, a clean lock to carry forward (current kalibrate-rtl builds print the equivalent trailing line as an `average absolute error: %.3f ppm` figure, per `src/offset.cc`) [kalibrate]. Tuning gqrx to that centre would confirm a steady 200 kHz downlink picket. Carried forward into the capture step, `grgsm_livemon -f 872.6M` on the same ARFCN (with the measured offset) demodulates the BCCH and streams GSMTAP into Wireshark, at which point the Oros42 IMSI-catcher reads the GSMTAP feed and prints the IMSI/TMSI the cell pages, with no transmit [grgsm][imsicatcher]. The carrier survey is the prerequisite: without the ARFCN, power and offset from this step, the capture is aimed at nothing.

## Remediation

This is an environmental baseline and target-selection step, not a device defect, the "weakness" it surfaces (a continuously-broadcast, unauthenticated carrier whose synchronisation bursts advertise the cell) is inherent to GSM's air-interface design [ts45002][dabrowski2014]. Layered guidance for what can be hardened around it:

- **Network operator**, you cannot hide the BCCH carrier or its FCCH/SCH bursts, but you can limit what the *post-survey* capture yields: page by TMSI rather than IMSI and minimise IMSI exposure during location update, run the strongest available ciphering (A5/3, not A5/1), and monitor for anomalous carriers / unexpected ARFCNs that signal a fake cell mimicking your network [dabrowski2014]. Where possible, retire 2G or gate downgrade from 4G/5G, since legacy GSM is what makes this survey-then-capture chain reachable.

- **Device integrator**, select basebands that resist silent downgrade to GSM and that surface 2G/rogue-cell indicators to the user; a device that never falls back to an unauthenticated GSM carrier removes itself from the population this survey targets [dabrowski2014].

- **Auditor / operator of the test**, keep this step strictly receive-only; do not transmit on licensed cellular spectrum. Treat the band/ARFCN/power/ppm inventory as scoping data, confirm each target carrier is inside your receiver's tuning envelope before committing capture hardware (RFSAM-RES-01), and conduct any identity-harvesting or active follow-on (rogue cell, decrypt) only on your own equipment with test SIMs, RF shielding and explicit written permission [dabrowski2014].
